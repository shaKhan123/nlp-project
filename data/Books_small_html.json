She develops a world unlike any others while keeping it firmly in the real world.  This is a very well written and entertaining novel.  I was quite impressed and intrigued by the way that this solid storyline was developed, bringing the readers right into the world of the story.  I was engaged throughout and definitely enjoyed my time spent reading it.I loved the character development in this novel.  Da Silva creates a cast of high school students who actually act like high school students.  I really appreciated the fact that none of them were thrown into situations far beyond their years, nor did they deal with events as if they had decades of life experience under their belts.  It was very refreshing and added to the realism and impact of the novel.  The friendships between the characters in this novel were also truly touching.Overall, this novel was fantastic.  I can&amp;#8217;t wait to read more and to find out what happens next in the series.  I&amp;#8217;d definitely recommend this debut novel by Da Silva to those who want a little YA fun with a completely unique &amp; shocking storyline.Please note that I received a complimentary copy of this work in exchange for an honest review.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;An amazing first novel&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1396137600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 30, 2014&quot;}</td>

To be happy or frightened or whatever emotion.  Right now, there are too many conflicting emotions.  I&#39;m glad I read this book, but I wish I had never picked it up.  I haven&#39;t check to see if there is going to be more to the story, because I don&#39;t want to hope, then again I don&#39;t want to changeWhat happens.  Basically, I am a confused mess.

Finally Honor and Grayson get together, we&#39;ve all been waiting for this since Brutes book! I feel bad for what happened to her in London so I cheered when she finally let go her rage and went for Angus&#39; throat in the story! It was a long journey for her to get to that stage, she&#39;d had a lot of healing to do but when she let go of her fear and attacked him I couldn&#39;t help the smile on my face!I loved how patient Grayson was with her throughout the book, helping her heal. I also loved that we seen another side of Alex and Maya when they were dealing with Honor at the start but my favourite thing about Ridgeville was how they all came together to help Honor in any way they could. The chemistry between Grayson and Honor was amazing and they certainly built the sexual tension between them until Honor was ready to mate with Grayson. She had some demons to face before she could be in the right headspace to mate with Grayson without freaking out!I hope there are more Ridgeville books as there are a few characters we didn&#39;t see (two we heard mentioned, one who appeared and a new character I&#39;d like more off) that I&#39;d like to see get their HEA, like the Mastin sisters and Stone as well as Deuce&#39;s sister too.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Excellant!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1401753600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 3, 2014&quot;}</td>

As an older woman, 60+, I will always be a bit shocked at the explicit sex scenes in romance novels, however, this book has a story that is deep and moving which holds you right down to the last sentence. I loved the humor that was infused throughout the book. I laughed out loud, and shed a few tears. (not the norm for me, especially the laughter) The author was able to give me a book that I didn&#39;t want to put down until I finished, and what truly surprised me was that I enjoyed reading it a second and third time, normally, I am not one to even watch a movie twice. (I did that as a beta reader to give the best feedback that I could, but really enjoyed it each time discovering nuances in the story that I&#39;d missed the time before.) I would recommend this book to lovers of Romance Novels who enjoy story lines like Nicholas Sparks has written and aren&#39;t turned-off by a bit of the \&quot;Fifty-shades\&quot; explicitness. Great read!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Wonderful mix of tears, laughter, tenderness and sensuality.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1392854400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 20, 2014&quot;}</td>

The story starts out with a bang and the action doesn&#39;t stop. As with all of her writings, it is well written, great dialog, fast paced, and pulls you in immediately!

It certainly came to me highly recommended. My husband and I read this book along with the companion workbook with 4 other couples, and it was and arduous journey. For our group of Christian couples in happy marriages, there was just too much that did not apply to us. Sure, we each picked up a handy tip here and there, but it wasn&#39;t enough considering the length and repetitiveness of this book.I agree with the basis of Eggerichs&#39; main point in this book: If she gets the love she needs, she will give him the respect he needs, which will cause him to give her the love she needs. You get it - it&#39;s the cycle of love and respect. I gave it to you in one sentence instead of 24 chapters. If this book was about a third the length, I probably would have rated it at least 1-star higher.Every time our group met after the first time, we felt like we were struggling to get something new out of what we had read. The workbook is even worse. The questions are extremely verbose restatements of what is already written in the chapters, and there are a lot of them. Each couple would need to invest a couple of hours into each session, only to feel like we were trudging through the same material each time.We were also disappointed by the lack of scriptural references. Though the book is loosely based on Ephesians 5, the author rarely includes scripture in the chapters and more often uses letters from happy Love &amp; Respect retreat participants as teaching tools. Our group was hoping for more Biblical discussion than what we got.If your marriage needs work and you and your spouse have trouble supporting each other and understanding each other&#39;s point of view, this book may help you. If you are looking for a good small group discussion book for a group of happily married couples, I would urge you to pass. In fact, run away.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 2.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Very Repetitive&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1391904000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 9, 2014&quot;}</td>

Dr Morgan Sierra wears a stone on a thong around her neck, as does her sister. When her sister and niece are kidnapped, Morgan is told she must collect 10 other stones, called the Pentecost stones, from around the world to save them. These stones, one for each Apostle, were originally carved from the stone that closed Jesus&#39; tomb. I was impressed by the meticulous research into the lives of the original apostles and I liked the feeling of authenticity in the scene settings. In this day and age of faltering belief, this is a good book to read even if it is fiction.<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>overall<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-c1">3.0</span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>summary<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>Very Well Researched<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>unixReviewTime<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-c1">1391472000</span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>reviewTime<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>02 4, 2014<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>}</td>

There may be some things that seem odd or are hard to understand to you,...BUT.... But, the designer just may have had some information that you as a builder or operator are not privy to.The same applies to most of &amp;#34;us&amp;#34;. Dr. Lieberman clearly describes how we came about and how far we humans have drifted away from the designers intent. We enjoy escargot but avoid worms and most insects. Our ancestors would not have turned their noses up at either...raw.And and how that drift has caused us some pain and suffering. His terms are &amp;#34;Mismatch&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Dysevolution&amp;#34;. We have come so far in fact that &amp;#34;changing back&amp;#34; isn&#39;t always easy.Lieberman stresses two things, diet, and exercise. Our cousins, the Chimps and Gorillas spend much of the day walking and searching for food, they chew a while, sometimes rest a while and then start over. Walking is good! I believe he states it is almost as good for our bodies as running. At 82 I like that! Sometimes running is good, especially when a hyena or wild dog becomes interested in you. If it&#39;s a Cheeta or Leopard you&#39;re in big trouble.Actually some food can be better for us by cooking. Meat is easier to chew and now what we eat rarely has fur in it or fleas or maggots, which probably would have been eaten.The book is written for &amp;#34;us&amp;#34;, it is easily understood by laymen. I recommend it to anyone, in fact I sent a copy to a granddaughter who is a runner and mostly vegetarian.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Enlightening, Throughly enjoyable&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1399507200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 8, 2014&quot;}</td>

His book \&quot;Voice of conscience\&quot; is a real masterpiece and I enjoyed reading it to the core of my heart. This book \&quot;Road to Siran\&quot; comes as a sequel to his previous work. He stimulates the reader by evaluating the characters in such a way that it gives the readers a feel of freshness.The story starts with the old reminiscence of Erin from JFK international Airport and from where the author&#39;s writing took off with a momentum. The Character Erin is represented as a person with great interest on Ballet dancing and reading books. Her fathers death had made a strong imprint on her mind which resulted in exploring to know more about her Dad. Another character by name Elicia, friend of Erin is portrayed in a memorable way, she often changes her boyfriend and comes out as an high energetic character. The communication amid Erin and Elicia in the high school brings out our own memories during those good old days, they were depicted as naughty and  gets captivated to their opposite gender. The righteous Turkish Ozcan, very pretentious in nature to whom Erin got attracted at their first introduction.The author brings in equal mixture of Romance and thrill in his book, especially the non-verbal communication between Erin and Ozcan is a unique way of illustration . The unfathomable writing of his book makes the readers to associate with it emotionally which is the key triumph for the author. All the readers would enjoy and will experience enchanting feeling of love in this book. The greatest truth that actions of one will be the deciding factor of course of events in his life is nicely depicted by Kaya.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;A Tale of Love&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1390176000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 20, 2014&quot;}</td>

I am glad I did.While I did not love it, my lack of love was based on the total lack of a likeable character. The only redeeming value of the main character and narrator was the love he had for his daughters. The writing is superb with a well thought out and suspenseful plot.  I was somewhat confused by the ending--not sure if the author just did not know how to tie up everything and resorted to resolutions that were just unrealistic or whether his ending was calculated to show that even the narrator&#39;s love for his daughters was not real and that he was therefore just as despicable as the other characters.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;If you&#39;re looking for a warm and fuzzy read-this ain&#39;t it!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1404345600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;07 3, 2014&quot;}</td>

(Didn&#39;t know Coach Bryant was such a scholar on Roman philosophy, but that&#39;s another story for another time, another review perhaps!!!)Luck does come when preparation meets opportunity, preparation as defined by 10,000 hours work hard work and preparation, opportunity--and the traditional defintion of luck could figure in here--by when you were born. Not so much where you were born or into what economic circumstances you were born, but by the time of year that you were born.  In academics and athletics, for example, being born just days or weeks past the deadline for  admission or participation, could give a young person the significant advantage of having another year to develop mentally and physically thereby putting him/her a year ahead of others  enrolling or beginning participation at what is technically the same time.  This is defined by Gladwell as opportunity.Oh, luck does pay a part, such as who made the first computer availabale to Bill Gates, but it wasn&#39;t so much who or when as much as what Gates did with that computer, how hard he worked at it.  Some things are beyond one&#39;s control, but most things are not--if you are willing to work hard and, as Bryant would say, sacrifice along the way.Not necessarily a quick read, or an easy read, but a good, thought provoking read.The Epilogue is, by far the best part of the book, but to appreciate it, really and fully appreciate it, the other nine chapters must be read first.  Epilogue is very moving and insightful.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;This  Book Proves it:  Seneca and Bear Bryant Were Right:  Luck Does Comes When Preparation Meets Opportunty.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1394064000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 6, 2014&quot;}</td>

Surrounded by blueprints and plaster dust, though, she finds herself drawn into the story of a group of idealistic university grads from thirty years before, who&#39;d thrown off the shackles of bourgeois city life to claim the cottage and rely only on each other on the land.  But utopia-building can be fraught with unexpected peril, and when the fate of the group is left eerily unclear, Lila turns her attention to untangling a web of secrets to uncover the shocking truth of what happened that fateful year, in order to come to terms with her own loss and build a new future for herself.I was literally glued to the pages of this book.  I just couldn&#39;t take my eyes off the pages for even a second.  The story was solid, the characters well fleshed out and original and the surprises just kept coming.  I was literally rocked off my feet by the ending and had no idea what was coming as I was nearing the end.  I think shock is even a mild word to describe the end, I didn&#39;t see, nor even considered this ending.  What a powerful punch this story delivered.

It&#39;s also about newcomer, Gillian Parker, who just discovered she had a great grandmother who left her her estate.The story is fast paced and involves some mystery about someone who is causing &amp;#34;accidents&amp;#34; among the two main characters.  Gillian also helps Joe to loosen up on his parenting and give Jenny more space.  I really liked the characters in this book.  The mystery part is really pretty light and is resolved fairly simple, but sometimes that&#39;s good.

I mean who does that?!?! Who takes two of her most beloved male heroes and pins them against each other in a book?! Shay that&amp;#8217;s who! When the news broke everybody flipped a s***. I however LOVED the idea and I knew if anyone could pull it off it was Shay Savage. The way that authors mind works is &amp;#8230;..well, mind boggling! LOL We all already know that nobody writes a male POV like this author. I don&amp;#8217;t care what anybody says, I would argue that point till I&amp;#8217;m blue in the face but her mind works in mysterious ways I tell ya. This book had everything we come to expect from this author. It was full of action, suspense, crazy characters and hot , sexy steamy love scenes. I would have given anything to have just a little bit of Evan Ardens POV, (YES I AM an ARDEN lover get over it ladies I will NEVER switch sides LOL) I fully understand that this was Bastians book&amp;#8230;but I LOVE me some Evan :) You Bastian lovers will love this book!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Nobody writes a male POV like Shay Savage!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1403049600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 18, 2014&quot;}</td>

Crosby&#39;s characters are well developed, her use of the Scottish broque is nearly unparalleled, and her plot is new and imaginative.

In the wild of Colorado these two innocent children because to feel the stirrings of a first love between them but sometimes fate decides to step in and lay down a challenge. In this story fate stepped in a ripped them a part at a tender young age. Now with one in Colorado and the other in California time and distance separate them. Children grow up, they mature, they move on. Sarah and Will may seem like they want to move on with their lives but fate is always there like an elephant in the room nagging them both that something or more like someone is missing. Beware this book does have a massive cliffhanger but all will be resolved in the two books that follow in this trilogy. An emotionally charged read that will leave your breathless and needing to follow Sarah and Will on the remainder of their journey. I will say that I was a little concerned with the year when it began and as the novel passed. However after reading the novel I completely understand the authors reasoning for it and really believe this was such an asset to the novel now. I would definitely recommend this book in the future![...]Caitlin ZabekReviewer at I Heart Books&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Surrendering to Fate left me breathless...&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1389744000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 15, 2014&quot;}</td>

Is not just about s&amp;m desires and dom/sub role play. There is a love story hidden in there, disguised as obsession and possession in the only way damaged people sometimes love until they learn about trust. Looking forwad to the next part of the trilogy. Not overly sexual, though does deal in many aspects of lust, heavy references to genitalia throughout, many references to alternative lifestyle including what some may consider consentual abuse more psychologically harmful than physically to the characters. Not for tweens or teens. More adult subject matter. I didn&#39;t personally find anything offensive, but I also know how to keep an open mind about books/movies, etc.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Was a good book and a fun and quick read&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1404864000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;07 9, 2014&quot;}</td>

Despite all the mixed reactions people have had to the New 52, I&#39;ve been hearing a lot of great things from people I trust about this new take on Wonder Woman. But I was still on the fence so I waited until my library got a copy of the trade. Now after reading I feel like an ass for waiting for so long, because it is awesome.Wonder Woman has always been a blending of mythology and the DC universe, but Azzarello takes it to the next level. While some mythology and DC purists might not like the changes, I loved them. On so many levels.First, the feel of this story has more of a mythological atmosphere. It reminds me a lot of Neil Gaiman&#39;s Sandman series. We&#39;re dropped into the story, with a narrative that sounds right out of folk tale and action befitting a flagship title for DC. Yeah, this is a Wonder Woman title, while many people view her as a diplomat and peace keeper, they forget that she is also an Amazonian princess, equal in strength and power to Superman. In this story Diana doesn&#39;t hesitate to kicks ass and takes name.The story is compelling, the art is stunning, but above all that, this is a Wonder Woman I can relate to, as well as admire. She is bold, conflicted, and rightfully so. The very foundation of her existence is shaken. Everything about how she viewed herself, and her mother changes in this story, and still Diana stays true to herself and her mission.This is a dark story, lots of bloodshed, death and raw humanity. Which is right up my alley. The supporting cast is great, and diverse in very surprising ways (I LOVE Chaing&#39;s take on all the goods, especially Apollo). Gods like Hermes, Apollo and Eris are deeply involved in the story, along with the very human character Zola, who plays a big part in the story. Zola is awesome, she delivers a lot of fantastic lines that made me laugh out loud, but is also very sympathetic. She didn&#39;t ask to be thrown into the middle of a godly power struggle, but she does a great job of coping with all it.I also love the look of Diana in this book. Yes, she still has the hour-glass figure of the classic Wonder Woman, but she is taller, and broader. She looks like an Amazon of legend. She also fights like a warrior, gets in the action. Chaing does a fantastic job with action shots, and her design. Giving us enough of the old to keep her familiar, but with a whole new take on everything from her costume, complexion and stature. Paired with Azzarello&#39;s fantastic storytelling, we get a great example of a what a reboot can do. This team does it right.I can&#39;t recommend this book enough. Even if you&#39;ve never read comic books, if you like Wonder Woman, mythology, or just stories featuring kick ass women at the helm, you should give this one a try.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;A New Take on Wonder Woman, and I love it!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1398816000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 30, 2014&quot;}</td>

Many other books in the genre have heroines that make stupid stupid mistakes and insist on going alone into situations, even when common sense would deem otherwise. Yes, she listens to her husband, but not in a way that weakens her, but in a way that compromises so they are both satisfied. She&#39;s not a ding-a-ling.

They do display a considerable range of styles, from the purely jokey to the angsty and way too self-involved. This book is a nice antidote to those two extremes because it is at times both funny and insightful in a rueful and self-deprecating way.  By that I mean Ms. Gurwitch knows her way around a one-liner and around an extended goof of a story, (see \&quot;AuDum at the Apple Genius Bar\&quot;), but she also has a handle on wry commentary on the state of the recently 50. The emphasis is on wry commentary - there&#39;s no over the top hysteria, no relentless kvetching, no excess. We all get older, and some of the stuff associated with that is funny, or at least can be given a good-humored spin. That&#39;s what&#39;s going on here, and it is all done with honesty, a keen eye for the absurd, and a grown up appreciation of people and their foibles and preoccupations.  So, if you&#39;d like a gentle, humorous reminder that you aren&#39;t alone as you hit 50, this could be a very nice choice.Please note that I received a free advance ecopy of this book in exchange for a candid review.

This issue collects several issues of Iron Man for a two-part arc titled Stark Resilient. Earlier issues had Iron Man wiping out his own memory to protect his IP rights, but forgetting to do a backup. thus, when they revived him, there are gaps in his memory. This reminds me of the expected downtime of my own home computer...There are genuine gaps in his recall and sometimes, Tony fakes amnesia conveniently. His new armor is regenerated from his own tissue (whatever). It&#39;s a convenient way to don the suit. Pepper hankers for the same treatment. So his armor is frontline main battle tank stuff, and hers is logistics support vehicle stuff. Rhodey questions his own role in this new technology era (he doesn&#39;t get the instantaneous armor capability - why not?).Storyline is acceptable.

Without being mushy, she has left a witness of her faith and the faith of her family in the Lord who gave them strength and trust in Him through all of this.  This would be an awesome book, very well written if it was fiction.  Knowing that it is a true story, makes it that much more incredible!  Not only is it an incredible story, Lindsey O&#39;Connor is an exceptional writer!  She has a gift with writing that makes you picture things vividly.  I cannot say enough good things about this book, or recommend it enough!  I left many chores undone because I did not want to stop reading!  If I could give this book 6 stars, I would!

This book is so much more than just the story that Holczer has written.  It is an absolutely beautiful book, full of wisdom and sadness, and hope.Grace is twelve years old when her mother dies in an accident. It has always been just the two of them against the world. Grace&#39;s father died before she was born, and although she knows she has a grandmother out there somewhere, she has never met her.  Grace&#39;s mom and grandma didn&#39;t see eye to eye on things when Grace&#39;s mom was pregnant with her, and she left town, never returning.  The two move often, not really allowing themselves to settle in any one town.But now that her mom has passed away, Grace is being sent to live with her grandmother, a woman that she is sure she is not supposed to like.  Her grandmother&#39;s life feels far from the one she was accustomed to living with her mom.Grace continues to want to live in the Before....before the accident, not the After.  Her grief is still new, and as she tries to mourn the loss of her mother, she is also adjusting to a new school and her grandmother, who doesn&#39;t seem nearly as horrible as she anticipated.Grace learns a lot about life and about love and about moving on.  Holczer&#39;s novel is so beautifully written.  There is an important message within this story, and although I just finished reading this myself, would love to start over again so I can enjoy the wisdom that is imparted in its pages.This is a novel I will be recommending to everyone from my middle grade readers to my adult friends.

She loses her job, etc. and before all her $ runs out, she moves out of state to live with an old friend and start &amp;#8216;something completely new&amp;#8217;.  Her new life involves different jobs, mentoring a juvenile pyromaniac from the Big Sisters rooster, a hot new bf, a new business, her mother in law&amp;#8217;s senility, and the  return of her marbles.When she described herself as a widow, and said she was a &amp;#8220;Jack Daniels kind, not the Jackie Kennedy kind&amp;#8221;, I burst out laughing.The novel explores grief.  I enjoyed it, but caution the reader that it is a bit of a downer, because after all, her perfect first husband died.I did not like that the widow was so selfish, when her mother in law was obviously going off her rocker, she was so wrapped up in herself, that she did nothing.  However, she redeemed herself, by bringing MIL for a visit, and then eventually keeping her.If I were describing the novel on a graph, I&amp;#8217;d say it starts ok, then goes down down down, then gradually goes up to a nice level.  The graph would mirror her life.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Novel of Experiencing Grief and Finding a New Normal&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1403308800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 21, 2014&quot;}</td>

Let speechless at times and wanting to cry out loud I enjoyed the ride.Eden has hit on a theme that takes a lot to work with, Blake is a recovering addict and Gabi is his strength. I absolutely LOVED how Eden wrote how they first *meet* its so well written you feel like you are there witnessing it.Gabi has had her fair share of heartache in her life to and is slowly building her life up again. Her character is written in a way so that you would just love to be her best friend, but she doesn&amp;#8217;t let to many people close.There is so much more to Blake than the loud mouth jokester he portrays himself as. I felt for him and the way his character was written was so well done.I am really looking forward to seeing the guys in the next book, Eden has a winner with this serious, I just can&amp;#8217;t get enough!Highly Recommended&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Emotional and Sexy Highly Recommended!!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1392681600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 18, 2014&quot;}</td>

Even though I am not quite finished with this book, and still have a few pages remaining, I wanted to go ahead and write the review because I have learned and enjoyed so much during its reading. In fact, as soon as I am done writing this review, I am going to go finish the book.I grew up in a home, church, and social circle that viewed all forms of alcohol as ... well... evil. When it was mentioned that someone was drinking or that someone drank occasionally or socially, it was absolutely appalling. I am not sure how much of this was because of actuality or because of my perceptions of the situations where drinking was encountered, but it was a definite no-no to drink in any way, shape, or form.When I got older, I began encountering people that caused my views to conflict with the reality around me... in other words, I was meeting people who were clearly steadfast Christians, but they would drink occasionally or socially. My worldview didn&#39;t allow for this. In fact, many of the drinkers that I met were by far more dedicated to the cause of the gospel than the teetotalers that I had known. So I did what any good Christian would do... I shunned them and ignored these conflicting worldviews. WAIT! NO! I went to the Bible to determine the truth! What I found was quite different than what I had &amp;#34;known&amp;#34; growing up. My views needed adjusting.When I eventually encountered Drinking With Calvin and Luther!: A History of Alcohol in the Church by Jim West, which was a Christmas gift from my wife, my views had shifted appropriately and were fairly solid now on what the Bible actually teaches concerning alcohol, but were still hazy on the practicality of these new views. This book served to solidify those views, and give me direction on how to practically apply those views. It is a very Biblical book, but what was absolutely surprising to me was the actual history of alcohol in the church, which this book does an absolutely amazing job of bringing to light.I have a great respect for church history. I believe that it is important what Christians have believed historically. This is why I am a big supporter of reading and learning from historical documents, creeds, and books. Like Paul writing to Timothy, I am often saying, &amp;#34;Don&#39;t forget to bring my scrolls!&amp;#34; (2 Timothy 4:13) ... well for me ... &amp;#34;books!&amp;#34;  I mean, really, who am I, or who are we to believe that the last 2000 years Christians have gotten  it wrong? In fact, tracing the beliefs that have stuck can be extraordinarily enlightening. The amount of historical information and quotes that Jim West shares from remembered and respected Christian leaders through the ages was extraordinary. It never felt cumbersome reading this book, but I did find myself often wanting to quote different portions of this book. Especially those encounters with quotes from Martin Luther, like:&amp;#34;Do not suppose that abuses are eliminated by destroying the object which is abused. Men can go wrong with wine and women. Shall we then prohibit and abolish women?&amp;#34;~Martin LutherJim West also confronted the different teachings of the prohibitionist&#39;s views by going directly to the scripture. He displayed an amazing knowledge of the topic from the historical, the Biblical, and even the opposing view points. If you are actually interested in learning what the Bible teaches concerning alcohol, then I recommend this book. If you want to learn the Church&#39;s historical stance concerning alcohol, then I highly recommend this book.I would like to point out in advance, as a Pastor myself, that there were many members of the clergy, through the ages, that were paid ... not just monetarily, but with kegs of beer for the purpose of entertaining. I am not suggesting anything... I&#39;m just sayin&#39;...&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Pastors Paid with Beer!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1402963200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 17, 2014&quot;}</td>

I loved this book from beginning to end! One thing I find particularly appealing about Eloisa James is her uncanny ability to describe a person, not just their looks but their feelings as well and in this book she did not disappoint. Her description of India&#39;s reaction to a particularly condescending marriage proposal is a case in point, \&quot;Aggravation marched up her spine like a troop of perfectly dressed soldiers.\&quot;Both India and Thorn are strong characters, exceptionally good at what they do and accustomed to being in command, so when they get together sparks fly. A particularly witty exchange of letters early in the book in which neither backs down but both clearly enjoy the correspondence hints at the relationship to come. Despite their strength of character and despite their stubbornness both India and Thorn are vulnerable, largely due to difficult childhoods yet it is those hard starts to life that have shaped them into what they are. It is those vulnerabilities that made me warm to them.I found this book hard to put down. I found myself sneaking a few chapters when I woke in the middle of the night and struggling to stay awake so I could reach the end, yet also wanting to carry on living with the characters, and I guess that&#39;s the mark of a good book. Well done Eloisa James! another gem!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;One Of Her Best&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1396224000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 31, 2014&quot;}</td>

He ends up being a successful writer who spends time in Hollywood.  The main character is somewhat interesting-he is a tough, streetwise guy who has a high literary aspirations.  He sees himself as being very straight but many readers may not agree with his view of himself.The book starts out with an incident in Las Vegas casino where I have no idea what happened since I don&#39;t gamble but the narrator becomes friends with a man named Cully.Then it proceeds to tell the narrators struggles as a beginning writer, living in the  housing projects and working for the civil service.  This part I found interesting in part because I know many civil servants and people who live in housing projects.The narrator gets fired from the civil service then works for a famous writer named Osano.  This part of the book is boring.  We don&#39;t know much about Osano except that he wants to win the Nobel prize in literature and lives like a pig.  While we don&#39;t know what makes Osano a leading figure in US literature but we do know about his numerous personal failings.  This part of the book is bad.The best part of the book is the ending where the narrator goes to Hollywood and to me the book ended with a punch.  Some of the books stories of Hollywood life were excellent.There are some parts of the book that describe the workings of Las Vegas which I also thought was outstanding.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Parts slow and other parts outstanding&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1403827200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 27, 2014&quot;}</td>

So it was natural that I read her latest book. and was pleasantly surprised in the direction in which it took, a departure from pure crime to a more traditional novel. I am told that it is the first in a planed trilogy.It a novel with broad mature understanding that examines bonds people form: those between siblings, child to parents and vice-versa, to friends, comrades in arm, and even with four legged creatures. In this case the animals are primary horses. I know little about horses but my own dogs and cats provides me with a feel  how much a person can love and cherish an animal. However the size of horses adds an element of danger to the relationship as a horse can accidental or intentionally kill a person.The story centers around two families of the horse set, one that breeds and trains horses and the other who has a family business manufacturing transportation equipment for horses. There are a number of lesser characters that cluster around the families. The various threads of  relatioship quickly weave an interesting narrative filled with action and drama that should hold any readers attention. My hope is that Sally will be able to continue this trilogy.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;A Different Sally wreight&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1390867200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 28, 2014&quot;}</td>

This series is amazing. The way that author puts so much suspense and detail into these books makes you feel like you&#39;re really there. That&#39;s when I know I&#39;m reading a good book. When I can visualize it. When I finished these four I became addicted to the whole series. The next part is called <span class="pl-cce">\&quot;</span>The Cain Chronicles<span class="pl-cce">\&quot;</span> which I will be reviewing soon too.

I really enjoyed it. It had it all. It was about friendship, betrayal, finding love and finding yourself. The characters were well written and the story just flowed. It centers on the friendship between Charlotte and Nicole. They were best friends growing up but have been distant for 10 years. Nicole reaches out to Charlotte to come to Quinnipeague for a summer to help her write a cookbook. Charlotte feels she owes Nicole and agrees to come. This sets things up for a very interesting summer where friendships and marriage will be tested and love will be found. I highly recommend this book.

Skilton&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [0, 0], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;The first four John Corey books were very good -  not Charm School good, but good.  This one is talky and overlong.  Every chapter seems to end with some variation of the line, &#39;... and then we&#39;d find the Panther.  And one of us would die.&#39;  And there are 83 chapters.  I thought we were being set up for some alternate ending in which this did not happen, but DeMille is not John LeCarre (thankfully).  But the actual ending isn&#39;t all that satisfying.The author takes a shot at fleshing out the bad guy character early on, which was interesting, but then he just drops it and becomes repetitive.  The closer-to-home bad guy is a walking cliche.  John Corey&#39;s capacity to just be a plain jackass has grown beyond amusing here, and Kate Mayfield is given almost nothing to do.Almost all the action is packed into the last few chapters, and then, just when things got rolling, a sudden ending that wasn&#39;t worth the previous 500+ pages, basically reading about meetings.  The ending seems to leave open the possibility of a sequel, which could pit John Corey against one of his teammates from this book, whom he would secretly want to succeed.  Probably woouldn&#39;t be great.If you like this kind of stuff, and have already read the first four John Corey books, read any of the Sean Drummond books by Brian Haig instead.  The best ones are Man in the Middle, Kingmaker, and Private Sector.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;OK, if you really miss John &amp; Kate&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1389830400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 16, 2014&quot;}</td>

Luna is witty, tough, proudly dysfunctional in a gleeful sort of way, yet honestly broken, too. And though she&#39;s got a lot of Buffy Somers in her - she&#39;s not the &amp;#34;Chosen One&amp;#34; with super powers or super strength or resiliency. She knows the demonic because it&#39;s haunted her since childhood. She can see demons, she can fight them,  but the only thing she&#39;s got up on regular human beings is her knowledge and association with demons, and that&#39;s it.The story&#39;s pacing is smooth, with easily-consumed, concise chapters, and the story moves right along. Yardley is very confident in telling this story, and making this world seem real.  Also, we get the sense that the supernatural world we&#39;re exposed to here is merely a fraction of what&#39;s to come, so if you like supernatural mythos/mash-ups like The Dresden Files or Supernatural, this might be a good fit for you, also.Finally, I do want to address the issue of some tense slippage, which I saw someone mention in another review (that ironically misused grammar in its title). There is a little tense slippage, between first person present and first person past. But experienced readers will realize these are merely blips that got overlooked in the editing process, and they in no way detract from the story at all. Even big NY publishers miss small things like. A proofing issue is not indicative of poor writing.Pick this up today, and join Luna on The Demon Patrol. You won&#39;t regret it.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;What happens when Buffy Meets Odd Thomas&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1394841600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 15, 2014&quot;}</td>

As anyone who has gone to college knows, this is an all too familiar pattern and I feel that many people can relate to Victoria Gardner&amp;#8217;s weight problem and will benefit from hearing about her success with Volumetrics. Gardner writes with a mix of humor and charm that makes her story appealing. I also like the fact that not only did Gardner change her eating habits; she also included exercise in her diet plan - two things that all doctors recommend. I highly recommend this book for anyone who is looking into diet plans and want one that doesn&#39;t involve depriving yourself of certain foods.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Diet with No Deprivation&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1403395200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 22, 2014&quot;}</td>

Blackberry Winter was a Kindle Daily Deal and the description sounded interesting. At worst, I&#39;d be out three dollars. At best, I&#39;d find one of those gems that sneak up on you. Blackberry Winter is definitely a gem.Blackberry Winter weaves together two different tales of struggles and loss. Vera heads to work one evening and when she leaves there is snow blanketing the ground and her son is gone. Claire&#39;s life is in pieces and it takes a snow storm to put her on the path to fixing herself. The stories are beautifully interwoven, constantly pulling at my heart and never giving a moment of rest.I did figure out early on most of how the characters are connected. I initially thought that knowing the big mystery would take me out of the novel. It didn&#39;t at all. I still needed to know how things got from point A to point B and all the little pieces in the middle.Vera&#39;s story had me in tears. The pain she went through is something no mother should ever have to go through. And to have it set in 1933, when times were dire or times were fantastic, all depending on how much money there was to your name. She worked hard to make life as good as she could for her son, and it was so easy to feel the love she had for him.Claire is going through her own heartache. Her world has been broken to bits and she&#39;s not sure how she&#39;s supposed to put it back together. When a May snowstorm hits and she comes the story of Vera and Daniel Ray, something in her compels her to dig the truth out. She needs to find out how Vera&#39;s story ends and I loved going on that journey with her.Sarah Jio is an author that hadn&#39;t been on my radar before. But after reading Blackberry Winter, I will definitely be reading more of her writings. She wove a breathtaking story through these pages and had me tearing up at the end. This is a book that needs to be read.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Wow&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1388793600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 4, 2014&quot;}</td>

While I LOVED LOVED The Coincidence of Callie and Kayden, The Redemption for me was heavy and intense. This couple had a lot to work through namely Callie trying to save Kayden as he has done for her. What I appreciated the most from this story was Callie&amp;#8217;s strength to not give up on her love for Kayden. This girl proved to me time and time again how far she has come since book 1 &amp;#8211; all because of Kayden. And this book was her returning the favor and never giving up on the hope and faith of their love.When Kayden begins to finally open up to Callie again &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s like a breath of fresh air and I am sighing with relief because I am seeing a sliver of hope for that boy we once knew in The Coincidence. Kayden loved her so much and it destroyed me to see him push her away, feeling that he was not worthy. Together they are pieces of a missing puzzle and my world feels complete and full. Seeing Kayden feel and understand this love that is given to him so freely is beautiful.What made my heart soar was watching them both face their pasts head-on and together. As we all know, confronting your demons and your past is a hard thing to do but when you have love at your side anything is possible.This was a beautiful story of hope, healing and acceptance. Both characters who were so emotionally broken, being able to recognize their soul mate within each other and finally moving forward to a life and love that they both deserve together was simply beautiful!

What you have is Dallas. A retired fighter working now as a business man who is in the market for selling equipment and new gears for fighters. He makes a good living at it too. He has just about everything a man can ask for. Money, cars, beautiful home but what he wants most is Amanda. His secretary. She considers him basically a man whore and to him he agrees but no longer. He wants Amanda bad and knows that she is a commitment type of girl.  He has tried and and she turns him down all the time but he has now found a way to &amp;#34;blackmail&amp;#34; her into giving him a shot. His expensive nipple clamps are missing. His security staff sets up a camera and we find out who the culprit is. None other than Amanda but looks can be deceiving.  What he finds out in the tape is that she wants him too.  Now he has a chance to get her. Will she see the error of her ways and following his lead or will she except the terms an go to jail?  You will have to read and seeWow, this was a quick sexy read but it packed a lot of punch.  It&#39;s sexy, quirky, and fun. I really enjoyed this story and it had me from the get go. I so didn&#39;t want to put it down.Dallas is a hottie. All the gals want him. He&#39;s rich  and can get anything he ever could want. But he wants some one that wants him for him. Amanda is that girl but she has seen way to many girls come and go and ultimately doesn&#39;t want to get hurt. It&#39;s all about taking a risk. You either reap the rewards or your learn from your mistake.  Their banter was hot and sexy and man it just was on fire!!!!It might be a quick read but it was well worth it. You gotta get it. You will be satisfied.Story 5Sex 5Overall 5++++Reviewed by Shay for Crystals Many Reviewers&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;LOVED IT&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1402876800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 16, 2014&quot;}</td>

The story is told primarily through the eyes of a young Jewish man, Jacob Weisz, Weisz is arrested and transported to Auschwitz for his part in freeing 200 Jews who are being transported by train to Auschwitz for eventual extermination.  While Weisz is a fictional character, this chronicle of his ordeal and eventual escape from that notorious death camp is very real.  I cannot begin to image what innocent people went through at this place of true horror but this novel does create a believable picture of one man&#39;s existence there.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;A Very Readable Novel Involving a True Historical Disaster&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1395705600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 25, 2014&quot;}</td>

This book is full of fun, drama and super steamy!This book is about how two people who are distancing themselves from even the remote possibility of love can change if the right person comes along!Andi is young and beautiful but her once sense of hope at a happily ever after has been lost. After she caught her fiance cheating, her whole outlook on love changed. After regaining control of her emotions, Andi decided never to let a man hurt her like that again. Now, Andi plays a game . . . the kind that keeps her heart safe but her needs met. Andi keeps men for one weekend, 3 days, of fun and excitement then she is done. She gets all the fun she wants with no commitment and no disappointment. Then Jackson happened . . .Jackson is rich. successful, handsome and oozes sex! But, Jackson comes with his own personal relationship drama that has left him scared too. When he hears Andi offering her game up to a stranger in a bar he decided to play along. He is completely down for a weekend of fun with no emotional attachment at the end. The weekend started out super hot right from the start in the club office . . .But it does not take long into their 3 days for you to be able to tell that what they are feeling is more than sex. When the weekend ends and they part ways you desperately want more for them. When life throws them back together can they get past their past baggage and work on their present?This whole book had me enthralled. I loved watching these two characters develop both individually and together. The flashbacks from their darker days really helped shape the characters for me and gave me great insight into why they handled things the way that they did. I though that K. Webster did a phenomenal job at producing a strong debut and I cannot wait for the other two books in this series!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;A Steamy Debut&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1392422400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 15, 2014&quot;}</td>

All the elements for a great read are present, believable characters, logical plot development, background with an integrated timeline, plausible story, the right amount of tension, and except for an unwanted open ending added to perhaps provide a segue to a sequel, the novel is perfect.

Stadt&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [1, 4], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;If one were to be politically correct, that is, ideologically sound, one would characterize the debate between Darwinism and intelligent design as between science and the Bible, between reason and superstition.  That is how it is essentially portrayed in the media and the scientific establishment.Author Jonathan Wells, however, is anything but politically correct.  He portrays the debate as a conflict between two views of what is real.  On the one side are the Darwinists, protectors of a materialist creation myth which begins with the words \&quot;in the beginning were the particles in mindless motion.\&quot;  And on the other side are proponents of intelligent design, most of whom would affirm John chapter one, \&quot;in the beginning was the Word.\&quot;Not all I.D. proponents are Christians, but all are open to the possibility that nature may show the hallmarks not only of natural causes but also of intelligent causes.  This is decidedly a politically incorrect point of view, and with examples Wells illustrates the professional cost one may incur for holding it.By citing philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn, he shows why the current Darwinian power structure is digging in its heels and refusing to consider evidence that does not comport with its materialist paradigm.  But if Kuhn is right, Wells has reason to be confident that even now we are seeing the beginning of a paradigm shift as the last and strongest bastion of nineteenth-century materialism - Darwinism, crumbles before the growing onslaught of the evidence.  Darwinism may go down kicking and screaming, but it will go down.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;The Heart of the Matter&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1389052800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 7, 2014&quot;}</td>

In Suzan Lauder&#39;s debut novel, Alias Thomas Bennet, she places Mr. Bennet in a role he does not often have the good fortune to occupy &amp;#8211; the role of hero!In this novel Mr. Bennet takes more interest and care in his family.  He doesn&#39;t make sport of or ignore his wife, and she in turn is a bit more sensible and economical.  He isn&#39;t careless with his finances and management of Longbourn, which results in a very comfortable living situation and adequate dowries for his daughters.  When Mr. Darcy comes to town, he finds the Bennets (especially Mr. Bennet and Elizabeth) to be very intelligent and pleasant company.  How do the improved manners and abundance of propriety in the Bennet household effect the illustrious Mr. Darcy of Derbyshire...Is Elizabeth still inferior?  Is marrying her still a degradation?What an originative take on Pride and Prejudice! I enjoyed seeing how the different dynamics of the Bennet family impacted the storyline, and the happy and congenial atmosphere around Longbourn was heartwarming to witness.  Much better than their usual disorder and disfunction!  I enjoyed seeing Mr. Bennet be active in his daughters&#39; lives and take steps to protect them from Wickham.  While at times, I may have thought the Bennet family a little too near &amp;#8220;pictures of perfection,&amp;#8221; I overall enjoyed seeing them portrayed in a more favorable light for a change!What I loved most about this story was that it had a duel plot &amp;#8211; besides the present-day story of Mr. Bingley letting Netherfield Park, readers learn about the traumatic experiences Mr. and Mrs. Bennet faced twenty years ago and how those experiences brought them together through periodic flashbacks.  For me, learning the secrets of their past and witnessing their falling in love was my favorite part of the story.  More so than the Darcy and Elizabeth  storyline!  (I know, how shocking, right?!?)  In fact, I would have loved to see more of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet!  Especially Mrs. Bennet &amp;#8211; if Mr. Bennet is this story&#39;s hero, I think she should be the heroine. :)Unique and enthralling, Alias Thomas Bennet is a wonderful choice for readers who want to see a different side of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet!  I sincerely hope we see more creative and unique novels pour from the pen of Suzan Lauder real soon!Warning:  Some sexual intimacy (between Darcy and Elizabeth) and sexual violence (not between Darcy and Elizabeth)Austenesque Reviews&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;So You Think You Know Thomas Bennet...&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1392336000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 14, 2014&quot;}</td>

The day she leaves her home to find work, she has an unexpected guest. Marco Black, from Nemesis Unlimited, has taken the job of trying to get her fortune back. Nemesis heard about Bronwyn&#39;s trouble from her former maid. They normally didn&#39;t help the nobility, but they were convinced that Bronwyn was worthy.They soon learn that Bronwyn&#39;s late husband&#39;s business manager stole the money to cover his gambling debts and travel to Paris to find him. After locating the man, they learn that he owes money to one of France&#39;s most ruthless crime syndicates, Les Grillons. Unfortunately, the business manager can&#39;t pay back the money he owes and is soon killed. Since Bronwyn and Marco witnessed the murder, they are now on the run from Les Grillons.Marco searches out a former associate of his for help. While running from Les Grillons, Marco and Bronwyn can&#39;t fight their attraction to each other and soon become lovers after agreeing that this would be a short affair. But what happens when their feeling start to run much deeper?I LOVED this story. You see bits of Marco in the other books in the series and knowing that he was a spy for England had intrigued me. His story did not disappoint me.Browyn was not your typical society wife. When she lost all her money, she didn&#39;t lose it. She had set a plan in motion when Marco swept in to help her find the missing money. Had she been the typical society miss, Marco would have never fallen for her. His background working with Nemesis has given him a dislike of the upper class. It said a lot to Marco that Bronwyn&#39;s maid was the one asking for help. She had to be someone special to inspire such loyalty from an employee.As with all the other stories in the series, the significant other seems to fall right into the life of Nemesis. The organization plays such a big part in their lives that the relationships wouldn&#39;t work otherwise. Because of this, these stories are not your typical historical romance with the relationships taking place at several society balls. If you are looking for that type of story, this book (and series) is not for you. But if you are looking for a historical romance with some adventure and mystery then this is the series for you. I&#39;m really hoping that Archer continues to write this series as I just can&#39;t seem to get enough of it.Thanks go to St. Martin&#39;s Press via NetGalley for a copy of the book in exchange of an honest review.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;LOVED it!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1402704000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 14, 2014&quot;}</td>

I liked this one as well, and although they are two very different books, I have similar things to say about this one, which is that I enjoy her writing but am not really a fan of her plot twists.  This book has two plot twists; the first one takes place about halfway through and is fine, but the second one takes place in the final pages of the book and I could have done without it.  For a moment, it felt like the rug was pulled out from under me, and although the author put it back, it was rather jolting.  I think things could have accomplished it in a different way.  Having said that, her story flows, the characters are interesting, there is some humor, and  I like her analogies and imagery.<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>overall<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-c1">4.0</span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>summary<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>two twists<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>unixReviewTime<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-c1">1391731200</span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>reviewTime<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>02 7, 2014<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>}</td>

Bartell \&quot;MissMelysse\&quot;&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [0, 0], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;Thanks to the Amazon class action suit about ebook price fixing, and a lovely $60 payout, I&amp;#8217;m catching up on many, many Star Trek novels that I missed during the years when I wasn&amp;#8217;t reading them for whatever reason.One such acquisition was the Star Trek: The Next Generation novel Dark Mirror, by Diane Duane. It&amp;#8217;s TNG&amp;#8217;s chance to experience the &amp;#8220;mirror universe&amp;#8221; we got to see on-screen in both TOS and DS9, and, as I expected it to be, it was well written, with a few moments that really delighted me.One was the introduction of the dolphin, Hwiii, a hyperstring researcher who &amp;#8216;swims&amp;#8217; through the ship in a sort of water skin. Another was when Data, meeting Hwiii, tilts his head for a moment and then &amp;#8216;speaks dolphin,&amp;#8217; because, of course he does.I liked that Geordi and Deanna were the initial away team to the mirror Enterprise, and that they both got to use the knowledge they gleaned both from study and experience. Some of my favorite episodes were when Troi actually got to be a psychologist, and in this novel, she uses that training as much as she uses her innate empathetic abilities.Similarly, Geordi&amp;#8217;s incredible depth of knowledge is highlighted in this book, as he works, sometimes with colleagues, and sometimes alone, to figure out a way to save, not just the ship, but the universe itself.I&amp;#8217;m not sure when this was originally written but it felt like early TNG-fic. Data is very &amp;#8216;sciency&amp;#8217; but doesn&amp;#8217;t have as much depth as he does in later novels &amp;#8211; even in later pre-emotion-chip ones. It&amp;#8217;s obviously before the contemporary push for continuity within the novels, but it&amp;#8217;s still an entertaining read.Trek fiction is my crack. This was a delightful fix.Goes well with Sashimi and tempura and Kirin beer.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Uneven in places, but enjoyable.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1396915200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 8, 2014&quot;}</td>

I don&#39;t give many books 5 stars, most that I enjoy get 4 stars, but this one I thought was worth it.  I&#39;ve been waiting for Lynsay to get back to the long running plot line of Leonius Livius II.  Within 5 minutes you were rooting for Basha (Devine) and I for one really liked her.  Most immortals of her age don&#39;t know anything about the mortal world anymore, Basha is the exact opposite.  I must admit I was waiting for her confrontation with Lucian for the entire book and that did not disappoint.  You feel for everyone in that circumstance.  My only suggestion is that I would have added one more chapter to the end of the book after they got home.  I guess we&#39;ll have to wait til the next book to see them living happily ever after. :)<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>overall<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-c1">5.0</span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>summary<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>I absolutely loved this book!<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>unixReviewTime<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-c1">1394841600</span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>reviewTime<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>03 15, 2014<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>}</td>

There is so much raw emotion, and battle scars in this book I feel like I need therapy!  Sergeant First Class Reza Iaconelli, where to start&amp;#8230; My heart broke for him. He was pure male power wrapped up in a lot of personal demons.  I seriously had to catch my breath a couple of times with him.  He is full of contradictions.  Physically he is all male. Big and physically strong.  Emotionally he is living one day to the next trying to function as best he can.  He tries to be the best Sergeant he can for his soldiers.  He is sympathetic to their insecurities yet battles with how to adequately prepare them for the realities of war and military life.  Reza is a recovering alcoholic, he struggles everyday with his addiction.  He is also surrounded by soldiers that have the same struggles.  Aside from struggling with alcoholism he is also dealing with PTSD.  Reza came with his own scars before joining the military and we learn about his home life and how it shaped him.Captain Emily Lindbergh is the opposite of Reza, although she struggles with her own personal issues, she comes from a life of privilege.  Her father was in the military but she never personally experienced the life of a soldier.  She is trying to bring help to soldiers such as Reza and his men, but not everyone thinks this is a good idea or is very welcoming to her.  Emily was a fantastic character.  She tried to show the soldiers her commitment to their mental health and was often the target of military personnel&amp;#8217;s wrath.  Emily is alarmed at the high number of suicides and tries to provide the soldiers with some psychological support.As a couple Emily and Reza where exact opposites yet perfectly matched.  Where he is physically strong and emotionally weak Emily is physically weak but emotional very strong.  They had excellent chemistry and I loved that they formed a strong friendship.  I loved that they each met the other where they were at.  Emily never tried to &amp;#8220;fix&amp;#8221; Reza she accepted and gave him the support he needed although at times did not want.These characters were so real, Scott really peels back all their emotions and gives us two very vulnerable people.  When I read &amp;#8220;Back to You&amp;#8221; I felt the same way.  The characters were both so imperfect and so real.  Ms. Scott really captures the damage that soldiers experience during combat, after, and before.Honestly, this is a tough read.  I put the story down a couple of times, not because it was not well written or interesting, because it was all of those; but emotionally very challenging.  The characters were worth it.  It&amp;#8217;s not a light read but it does provide a very &amp;#8220;unromantic&amp;#8221; look at the hardships of war and military life.  Overall, I think I can say that I recommend everything and anything written by Jessica Scott.  She really knows how to strip down her characters and show us who they are.  After the emotional odyssey it&amp;#8217;s beautiful to see Reza and Emily find their way together!  Another fantastic journey with Ms. Scott!!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;A-mazing / heart-ache/ with real people&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1391990400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 10, 2014&quot;}</td>

It&#39;s got delicious sexual tension as well. She is very close to being a writer I would automatically buy. There are just a couple things about her writing style that bother me a bit, but it may not be an issue for anyone else. One is that she over-complicates the internal  conflicts to the point that it&#39;s a bit too much and a little convoluted. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever had this problem with a romance novel, since too much depth is not usually a problem, but I think she could pull back a bit on that and give more plot and external conflicts. There was never much standing in the way of their romance except their own issues, which were real and compelling but got to seem like they were over-done to sustain them through the book. And she piled them on, not so much heaping too many things so much as examining them in-depth and in excruciating detail, in many different ways over and over. This leads to my second issue, which is way too much interior dialogue, characters dissecting everything that happens when we&#39;ve already get it. Much of this could have been cut out so there was a better balance of action and dialogue and the more interior writing. This might just be the writer&#39;s style and I might still read her, but it felt a bit like an overly rich dessert. Both of these issues are even more present in the first book in this series, &amp;#34;Live,&amp;#34; which I did not finish. You want to eat it, you do eat it, but you wish it had been just a little lighter.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Mary Ann Rivers is a wonderful writer and the characters in this book&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1406073600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;07 23, 2014&quot;}</td>

I would rate the book 2.5 stars with a summary that the author has the beginnings of what could be an interesting series, but would caution that Creedor itself is an average stand alone novel that lacks a cohesive storyline.  In the first 20% of the novel we are introduced to characters and a plot that I assumed would be the basis for the rest of the book, but this is not the case.  After being introduced to Jarlord (obvious antagonist) and the wizard Vandalen (obvious protagonist), we move on to new characters and plots that end up taking shape and making some sense, but by that time the reader is at the end of the book.....which ends rather abruptly just as I felt like I was beginning to make sense of the story.I will admit that I am not normally an avid reader of fantasy or science fiction, so I was likely not as patient as I might otherwise be with what I considered a disjointed storyline that I had difficulty following at times.  Nevertheless, there is enough promise shown by the author of Creedor that I will likely invest the time to read the next book in the series to see the outcome of what happens to Slogar, Camdus and Mara along with whether Vandalen commands a more prominant role in the next book.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Promising But Wandering Novel&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1396483200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 3, 2014&quot;}</td>

Vince&#39;s family arrives unexpectedly in town and he is in for more than one surprise.  Tina is trying to reform this town and finds that she may be going about it in the wrong way.  As these two are struggling and trying to find their place, they are also struggling with feelings that are arising between them.I loved this story as it shared the love that grows between Vince and Tina, but also continues the story for Jonas and the others.  Mary has done a great job with this series as the storylines and characters have been so fun and I felt like the characters all came alive and I loved their adventures and the bond that is so strong between everyone.

Nothing earth shattering, but an enjoyable, casual read..  I also bought the audible versions so I could listen on the go.  Got to the 3rd book and ... it isn&#39;t complete - I mean, it just ... stops.  So basically, you get 2 stories that are pretty decent then a longish series of chapters with an author&#39;s note at the end that there is more to come (after you shell out more $$ of course.)  If you want resolutions to a number of plot lines, you have buy book 4.  There doesn&#39;t seem to be an expected date for that installment.I expect, at this price ($23 + audio), to find a beginning, middle and end to EACH book, not a bait and switch for the next installment.  This made me so mad that I returned the book to Amazon - which I have never done before. I say steer clear - very poorly done.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 1.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;3rd Book is incomplete&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1401840000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 4, 2014&quot;}</td>

It is written by a man for men.Unlike many books which suggest aggressive approaches, misdirection, and head games, this book considers the underlying psychological differences between men and women and suggests reasonable and sensible methods for bridging the gap. It focuses on meeting a woman&#39;s needs without compromising a man&#39;s dignity.The book touches on personality types, what is acceptable and not acceptable in dating situations. I found the discussion on how to use Neuro Linguistic Programming (NLP) and Transactional Analysis (TA) when interacting on dates extremely valuable. NLP and TA are used to build a sense of compatibility that improves your date&#39;s experience - they are classic sales techniques.I&#39;ve now read the book a couple of times, and I will probably read it again. From discussions on when to walk away, and how to overcome barriers this book has shaped my thinking in a fundamental way and helped me be a better and more thoughtful dater.The author has my thanks for writing this book. Five stars. Highly recommended.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Really good book for a man&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1394928000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 16, 2014&quot;}</td>

The time out, Dewey&#39;s most recent friend, Kohl Meir from the previous story has been kidnapped by the Iranians who also happen to be plotting a nuclear armageddon for Israel. Given the delicate geopolitical situation with the US focused on an arms treaty with Iran, Dewey needs to both save Meir and secure the nuke without official sanction. With the assistance of off the books CIA private contractors Dewey organizes a plan for both.The pacing is excellent with nearly nonstop action. Both tradecraft and action scenes are well done and interlaced for page turning effect. With so many entries in this genre always revolving around inside plots with the supposed good guys plotting more mayhem than your typical terrorist, it&#39;s refreshing to see action with a classic John Wayne type character going up against true enemies.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Dewey being Dewey&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1390089600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 19, 2014&quot;}</td>

Never a dull moment and I was instantly caught in the story and did not want to go to work lol!Some parts of the story was making me so sad and where heartbreaking. It almost made me cry! Other parts had me laugh out loud.Charachters:Ellie Holbrook is the heroine in the book and I loved her. She has a very rough past littered with abuse, drugs and so on. When she finds herself pregnant she is forced to grow up and she excels at it. She is so mature for her age and is awesome with her daughter Sophie. She is confident and knows what she want. She does not joke around and when she knows what she wants she goes after it.Nicholas Grayson is the ultimate douchebag! I absolutely hated him in the beginning. His attitude sucked and I could not stand him. He did what he wanted just because he could. No caring at all if his actions harmed others. Bleh! Selfish bastard! That was until he met Ellie. She started out as a bet and eventually became so much more. Nicholas started to realize that the front he had put up was not going to work with Ellie and she made him want to be better.Romance:There was a lot of romance and it was hot and sizzling! A bigger rollercoster I would have to look for. Ellie and Nicholas love story has so many ups and downs that you almost get dizzy. But it totally works and thats what makes their love so awesome. The can be so perfect together and other times they are a total disaster waiting to happen. As the book so adequately is called their love really is a beautiful disaster :)Action:Not much action as in real fighting but there was a lot of other types of action in the story. It felt like it was Ellie and Nicky against everyone else all the time. A lot of other characters had their own agenda as to why they should not be together and had no limits of how far they would go to get it.Cover:Simple and lovely! Don&#39;t you think?&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Perfect!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1402790400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 15, 2014&quot;}</td>

This book is amazing.We are immediately drawn into the life of Bonnie Rose (O&amp;#8217;Brian) and the mystery surrounding her and her little sister. Lisa does a great job of feeding the reader bits and pieces of what happened to Bonnie Rose but never giving you the whole bite all at once. This is perfect and kept me fully engaged.In this book we are bouncing back and forth between Bonnie Rose&amp;#8217;s story in the past to Allie Kirkland&amp;#8217;s story in the present.Again, with Allie you are receiving bits and pieces of this back story, just enough to keep you wanting more. Allie is working on a set that will be reenacting Bonnie Rose&amp;#8217;s story. Even Allie doesn&amp;#8217;t know the story so nothing is given away.I found the set up that Lisa (the author) did with this book very good. Each story builds into the other. It&amp;#8217;s like getting pieces of the puzzle. You know when you are putting together a puzzle and you are search for that one piece and you find it? You have that &amp;#8220;Ah-ha&amp;#8221; moment. Every chapter is like an ah-ha moment.There&amp;#8217;s also some romance too. Bonnie Rose meets a kind captain on the boat that takes her to Wildwood Creek. She leaves him and I am hoping he will come to her rescue at some point in the book.With Allie there is the mysterious cowboy that I want her to get to know better.Yes, this books has all the ingredients of a excellent read.A copy of this book was given to me by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;All the ingerdients for an excellent read&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1393804800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 3, 2014&quot;}</td>

How do you fight for something when you are clearly holding on to something else?? Is that really putting your all into something else? i don&#39;t think so.My biggest pet peeve was the truth telling aspect. When Maxon found out about Aspen, how he found out didn&#39;t portray her in the best light. for me, why did you wait that long? There was a time when they were sharing their stories and it was a perfect opportunity for her to be honest about Aspen but she didn&#39;t. I never felt she truly liked one more than the another. I felt she was willing to take whoever was available and feel like *poor me* when the other didn&#39;t choose her. You are so much better than that America. If you simply took some time to think about it, you would know your answer in a heart beat.Finally, there were so many glossed over stories that made me so sad. Tell us more about the Northern rebels! How were they funded? How did her dad contribute?

The main characters, Becky and Joe, are maturing in a realistic way, as is their relationship as brother and sister. They are developing skills and using them in a thoughtful way, rather than just stumbling into the right solution. There is a major revelation about mid way that was totally unexpected, that lends new energy to the plot. I didn&#39;t want to put it down, because I felt like the major characters were old friends and I wanted to know what would happen to them.<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>overall<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-c1">5.0</span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>summary<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>Getting Better Every Time<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>unixReviewTime<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-c1">1400371200</span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>reviewTime<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>05 18, 2014<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>}</td>

Then she was offered a chance everyone at sometime wishes for, a way to go back to a certain time and start over. Funny, refreshing book about life choices, depression and taking a chance. Started out a little slow but the momentum and fun picked up and it truly was an interesting and intriguing story with some great characters.

There&#39;s a couple different reading orders for her books. I would go to her website and check out the series to see which one you want to start with!! I can&#39;t wait until her next book..

Epic!Awesomeness is not a good enough word to describe this brilliantly written story &amp;#8211; No I think Epic would sum it up nicely.  This captivating story is filled with a humorous seductive romance that kept me glued to the pages and wanting to live in their world forever.  The author&amp;#8217;s descriptive details of the Highlander&amp;#8217;s country side and their clan&amp;#8217;s leaves the reader with a breathtaking vision that will forever be melded into your heart.  The character&amp;#8217;s chemistry and humorous banter will forever have you longing for more of their story.Edmund MacGregor is a man of his word and beliefs.  God-like example of David &amp; Goliath, the metaphor is clearly a Highlander conquering and ending the Giants of Aristocratic Nobility&amp;#8217;s political gains.  His presence bleeds sexuality with his stance and handsome features, but his voice and actions will melt your heart first with a wanting desire.Dedicated to his cause for love of country and keeping the English from signing a treaty that will unite Scotland under their rule, he can only come up with one solution and puts the plan in motion to keep the treaty from happening and that is to capture the niece of the Duke of Queensberry.  However, what he doesn&amp;#8217;t anticipate is falling head over heels in love with his charming captive Miss Amelia Bell.  No his adventure turns into not only a win for Scotland but a fight for an unconditional sacrifice for love than to ever live without her.Amelia has got to be my favorite character of all time.  I absolutely loved her.  I never laughed so hard &amp;#8211; I literally had tears coming out of my eyes with her accident prone actions.  She reminded me of &amp;#8220;KANE - the demon of Disaster&amp;#8221; from the series Lords of the Underworld where every time she touched something or went somewhere disaster followed her in a humorous way.Amelia truly captured my heart with her tender innocent demeanor.  She is one of those females that is not only beautiful on the outside but on the inside as well.  Her loyalty and dedication to her family is unconditional but her love for true passion puts a few adventurous curves in her road to happiness especially when she meets her dreamy godlike &amp;#8220;David of Goliath&amp;#8221; Edmund.Tormented between having a life with a man of her dreams and with honoring her father&amp;#8217;s wishes of an arranged marriage to Seafield - the Lord Chancellor of Scotland, a man she doesn&amp;#8217;t love.  Amelia&amp;#8217;s heart breaks knowing the sacrifice she must make in order to not ruin her father&amp;#8217;s status among the English aristocrats.The story is full of adventure and lots of Highlander action making it a fast read.  The sweet and tender erotic romance had the perfect amount of teasing and playful love making scenes (3 Flames).  The happy ever after had me smiling and hugging the book with giddiness.I have to say that this is my first book by Paula Quinn and I am awed in amazement of how addictive her writing is.  The plot was perfect, the characters were brilliantly created, and the world building is one I could live in forever.  Paula Quinn you have gained a new fan and I look forward to reading more of your awesome work.  I highly recommend this read to all Historical Romance lovers.Excellent Read!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Brilliantly Written!

A lot of MilSF I read once and never bother to pick up again.This is just good old fashioned pulp sci-fi action/adventure fun and if that&#39;s all you&#39;re looking for in a book then I highly recommend it.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Maybe the most fun MilSF novel of them all&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1389398400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 11, 2014&quot;}</td>

Yes, its contents are BDSM based but the book itself is unique in many ways.  As a Master, Jonah has conducted his fair share of interviews, becoming bored with the same questions.Upon meeting a &amp;#34;green&amp;#34; journalist, Jonah makes the decision to give a real interview; an interview that is his story, from becoming a submissive at the age if eighteen to becoming a Master.Jason Luke takes us into the Lifestyle (authentically) because he was in the Lifestyle.  Not only are his words factual but Mr. Luke is well spoken which comes out in his flawless writing style; creates a story and characters that creates a &amp;#34;can&#39;t put down&amp;#34; book.I fell so deeply in love with this character that Interview holds only one flaw for me...not knowing if the story will continue.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Strong 5 Stars&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1391731200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 7, 2014&quot;}</td>

Berg.  This is Leah and Declan&#39;s story.  Both of whom were introduced in When You&#39;re Ready.  If you recall Leah is Clare&#39;s best friend and a nurse at the hospital where Logan, Clare&#39;s new husband works.  Declan is a famous movie star and one of Logan&#39;s college buddies.  Leah and Declan have a one night stand in book 1 and book 2 pretty much starts a few months later.I&#39;m not going to rehash the entire book or reword the synopsis.  I am going to tell you right off the bat that overall I thought this was a decent story.  Was it as good as book 1?  In my opinion, no, and I hope to tell you why I did and didn&#39;t like it.I thought the characters in Never Been Ready were well developed.  We get lots of insight on both Declan and Leah&#39;s upbringing as well as who they are as adults.  We learn what makes them tick, what makes the love and what makes them laugh.  Declan and Leah together on the pages are hot and steamy as well as light and fun.  There are even some poignant moments.  Those poignant moments are what I think J.L. Berg is really good at writing.I loved all the moments with Clare and Logan.  I missed them and I was super happy to have them back.  I also appreciated the introduction of Clare&#39;s brother, Garrett.  There were many obvious moments in the book where Garrett was being set up for book 3 in the series, Ready For You.This is the tricky part for me.  How to explain what I didn&#39;t like.  The only word that keeps coming to mind is lackluster.The premise of the story was good.  Leah&#39;s childhood plays an important role.  Logan&#39;s childhood as well is integral.  The way their two lives ultimately intersect is also really important and was well thought out.  There was even a shocking moment that gave me goosebumps.  Goosebumps are always good!!  I just felt like the journey to get to the good stuff felt forced and quick.  For instance there is a certain scene between an actress and Leah at an awards show.  I felt like that particular moment had absolutely no bearing on the story as a whole.  The story wasn&#39;t really about Declan as an actor and whether or not Leah could handle it.  There was also a scene near the end involving Leah&#39;s father.  It may have been an attempt to tie up loose ends.  Maybe even an attempt to open Leah and Declan&#39;s eyes.  Again, I thought it was unnecessary.  The story would have been good without it.  I didn&#39;t think Leah needed that closure.  I didn&#39;t think Declan needed that push.I felt this story had a much deeper meaning than a hollywood actor who sweeps a woman from an abusive home, off on a whirlwind relationship.  It was about two people broken and bruised by their parents, being able to come together as a couple and finding their way towards a future with each other.  It was about embracing the future and accepting what&#39;s in front of you.  Accepting who you are, what you&#39;re capable of and what you can offer someone in return.  This was a story about love, forgiveness, and hope.For as many times as I rubbed my eyes and scratched my head in frustration, I was however, also rewarded with those special moments.  This is where I love J.L. Berg&#39;s writing, there is so much potential here.&amp;#34;But that kiss?  That kiss left me awe-struck.  It was earth-shattering in its simplicity, mind-numbing in its intimacy, and completely raw in its emotional depths.&amp;#34; - LeahSigh....see?  That&#39;s beautiful right there.  Give me more of that and less fluff.  It&#39;s okay to have lots of angst, inter-mingled with funny and lighthearted moments, while still being able to give us beautiful lines.  I don&#39;t mind the insights into each others worlds.  On the contrary those are important for character development.  It&#39;s the other stuff, like the moment with the actress, or the box that Declan takes from the attic of Leah&#39;s childhood home, that doesn&#39;t reappear again until nearly the end of the book.&amp;#34;Shit.  I&#39;m going to cry again.  Why do I cry so much around you?&amp;#34;&amp;#34;I don&#39;t know, but I&#39;ll hold you every time you do.&amp;#34;I remember when I read that part I had to stop and smile at my husband because that&#39;s something he would say to me.  Those are the moments I like to look for my stories.  The stuff I can relate to or dream about or swoon over.  There is a really good story here in Never Been Ready, it just didn&#39;t come together for me as a complete package.Should you read this book?  Absolutely.  It might not be my favorite but it&#39;s still a decent read.  I&#39;m looking forward to learning more about Garrett in book 3.*A copy of this book was kindly provided by the author in exchange for an honest review*&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Declan and Leah are made for each other.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1392681600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 18, 2014&quot;}</td>

It wasn&#39;t until almost the end that I finally cared anything about any characters and then only Snake and Lindsey. I absolutely hate Eric and hate that I bought his novella before reading this as I bought the very inaccurate description, but that guy is nothing but a skanky lowlife. If there &#39;re actually Eric lovers out there, I would worry about their sanity. I was hoping him going off with the douche Major would be the last if him fir this series. In no way does he improve the book at all, except to make the reader cringe and think DIE already!!! I won&#39;t be reading the Eric novella I bought, but I will read the sequel only because it has a couple characters I now care about.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Issues&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1402963200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 17, 2014&quot;}</td>

This is the first time that I read the works of Ms. Lena Skye. I wanted to read this IR Romance &amp;#34;Billionaire&amp;#34; type book because there are so many available to choose from to read; and in my opinion, if you read 1 or 2 Romance &amp;#34;Billionaire&amp;#34; books then you would have basically read them all. This IR story by Ms. Skye has all you could hope for in a book: Sex, love, suspense, thriller, mystery, betrayal, comedy, romance, redemption, oh and a FINE Billionaire. Yes, it is all in these books. I also appreciate the way Ms. Skye gives us Camille and Kyle&#39;s POV. Camille is a Black woman looking for a new job. She has this great &amp;#34;I can do anything&amp;#34; attitude. She applies for a PA position in Kyle&#39;s company and get&#39;s it the job, even though the position was not what she expected it to be. But Camille &amp;#34;rides&amp;#34; it out and becomes the back bone of Kyle. In my opinion, and to my good surprise, Kyle grows to appreciate and love Camille and her background and turns out to be there for her, and she for him. This story has so much more to it than the great sex scenes. It was a pleasantly great surprise of a great read. Well done Ms. Skye.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;I PICKED A GREAT BOOK SET TO READ.....YOU HAVE TO READ THIS!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1400976000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 25, 2014&quot;}</td>

Here he presents a very good Loki story that delves into his personality and focuses on more than his jealousy of Thor.  I&#39;m glad he didn&#39;t try to make him seem like a misunderstood hero but an actual villain with interesting motivations.  Seeing Marvel&#39;s Norse history, no matter how many times its retold, is always a treat.  The art by Sebastian Fiumara was very good, although slighty rushed at times.  The darker elements of the story looked appropriately grittier than more joyous scenes.

That&#39;s as far as science can take us.  From that, Gordon-Reed takes bits and  pieces of folklore to create a glorified and highly exaggerated image of Sally Hemings.  Even if Jefferson fathered Hemings&#39; children, one should not make too much of it. When his wife died, Jefferson was still a relatively young man, with powerful needs. It would not be unreasonable for a man to use one of his slaves to relieve himself, any more than it would be unreasonable for him to use a prostitute. By many contemporaneous accounts, Hemings had sexual intercourse with many men on the bustling, but cloistered, Monticello estate. Powerful men have powerful needs and weaknesses. Even so, this does not elevate Hemings to the level of having a serious, significant relationship with Jefferson, any more than Bill Clinton&#39;s dalliances are serious relationships. The Thomas Jefferson-Sally Hemings&#39; bastards, if they exist, were nothing more than the product of  a sexual relationship of convenience. The book is worth reading, though, because Gordon-Reed does gather together in one place a great deal of Jefferson folklore, even if some of her conclusions are flawed.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Interesting, But Biased&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1392595200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 17, 2014&quot;}</td>

There are many possible reasons why the novel never &amp;#34;caught fire&amp;#34; for me, and I think that one may have been my misunderstanding of Dorothea Brooke and her marriage to Casaubon. I would recommend Mead&#39;s book if for no other reason than it has inspired me to pick up &amp;#34;Middlemarch&amp;#34; and give it another try. Mead gives a believable interpretation of Dorothea&#39;s actions and motivation, as well as an analysis of each of the major characters. Yes, there are many of what we today call &amp;#34;spoilers&amp;#34; included in this examination of Mead&#39;s favorite book, so if you have not read &amp;#34;Middlemarch,&amp;#34; and wish to, be warned.In addition to discussing the characters and the story of &amp;#34;Middlemarch,&amp;#34; Mead looks at George Eliot&#39;s life as it mirrors the various aspects of the book -- youth and the desire and need to find one&#39;s place in the world; love and courtship; what constitutes a good marriage or a bad one; how to deal with an intimate relationship with another person; growing older, and eventually death. Mead&#39;s book has been called a memoir by some critics, because she does mention some pertinent parts of her own life, and some actual physical journeys made back to England to look at many of Eliot&#39;s haunts. However, Mead&#39;s life is only a very small part of this book -- most of it has to do with the life of the author of Mead&#39;s favorite book, the lovely and haunting writing style, the sly humor, and the pointed observations on the nature of mankind that came to fullest fruition in &amp;#34;Middlemarch.&amp;#34;I do understand an obsession with a particular book -- mine being &amp;#34;The Forsyte Saga&amp;#34; by John Galsworthy. I have read Galsworthy&#39;s masterpiece at least one in every decade since the 1960s (and sometimes more than once). As &amp;#34;Middlemarch&amp;#34; calls to Mead, &amp;#34;The Forsyte Saga&amp;#34; calls to me, and I find something new in it every time. Just as Eliot knew the heart of her characters, even the more unpleasant or unsympathetic ones, I found myself identifying with the same character (&amp;#34;Soames Forsyte&amp;#34;) as I became older. While Galsworthy was not happy that so many readers identified with Soames, Eliot seemed to understand and forgive the characters, such as Casaubon, who were less than perfect and who presented barriers to loving and being loved over and over.I think this book will appeal to many different sorts of readers -- those who share the author&#39;s love of Eliot and &amp;#34;Middlemarch,&amp;#34; those who appreciate a well-written book that examines an author&#39;s life and work, and those who want to pick up Eliot&#39;s masterpiece but have been afraid to do so for any one of a number of reasons. Good show, Ms Mead, good show.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;A Homage to a Favorite Book&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1392681600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 18, 2014&quot;}</td>

Each chapter reads like that day&#39;s ramblings, not related to anything that&#39;s come before. Maybe he wrote this as therapy. Maybe he was bored by taking time off to rediscover his muse. (Btw, he found it. He recently played Carnegie Hall to some of his best reviews). Either way, this is Neil&#39;s mind, seemingly fully exposed. It&#39;s quirky, to say the least. And repetitious. This could have been cut in half. Still, you won&#39;t really mind because Neil really does have a lot to say, and much to recall of his storied career, which peaked by the early 70s. Yet, he&#39;s still creating great music, and his voice is still one of the wonders of rock. He is completely right in his crusade to upgrade the recorded music listening experience. Music did sound better before digital, and we have gone seriously backwards. He wants us to be able to feel music again. I hope the industry listens. Lossless digital tracks are coming for the masses. This is a worthwhile read for Neil fans.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Rambles, yes, but it&#39;s full of insightful nuggets&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1390608000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 25, 2014&quot;}</td>

Their touching meeting over the blackberries at a Whole Foods Market, was beautifully and tenderly written.  What follows is one of California&#39;s horrific fire seasons, with great descriptions, as well as a threat to the wild life shelter where Sarah volunteers.

The amount of historical detail that she works seamlessly into the plot is beautiful. And she treats all of her Indian characters as people, rather than stereotypes. (I want a book about Catches Bears!).There was never a moment that I felt jerked from the story, instead it seemed like I was there with the characters. I could perfectly see the forest with all of the animals and the people. The story of Franklin was one that I had heard of before, but she brought to life.My one complaint was that the story seemed to a little too perfectly, with every single thread tide up, even those that I had not realized were loose. While I like happy endings, it was somewhat too perfect. Not that it will stop anyone from loving this story.I received this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Amazing Research&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1398902400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 1, 2014&quot;}</td>

When Kate learns her younger sister is headed for marriage, she feels her biological clock tick. She&#39;s been dating James for 8 years, but it seems he&#39;s afraid to commit. Meanwhile, her best friend Judith is dating James&#39; brother, Paul. It&#39;s clear Paul is totally besotted by Judith, but when Kate and Paul get stranded at his family&#39;s ski lodge during a blizzard--a storm so severe that James and Judith cannot make it there as planned, Kate and Paul see each other in a new light. But...Paul is tied to Judith and Kate is tied to James. How can they find happiness together with their best friend/brother in the place they want to be.

Errington \&quot;Heavy reader\&quot;&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [1, 1], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;Relic Of Death is a brilliantly conceived and executed horror novella. Many times a novella will leave me wanting more on some level.  More story, more character development, more of something.  Relic Of Death is perfect, just where it is.It&#39;s difficult to give a story synopsis without revealing too much.  As you can tell from the beautiful cover (Darfuse always has exceptional covers), it has something to do with a mystical suitcase.The story is told through a series of vignettes as the object changes hands violently over time.  Before it all becomes too repetitious, Bernstein reveals the truth about the Relic Of Death and gives the tale some closure, for now.This is my first time reading David Bernstein, it certainly won&#39;t be my last.  With clear, crisp prose, he delivers page after page just what the story calls for.  No fluff, no wasted words.Relic Of Death is another winning entry in the Darkfuse novella series.  My bookclub membership is the best money I&#39;ve ever spent with a small press.Official release date is June 24, 2014.  Relic Of Death will be available in a variety of formats and if you have an Amazon Prime membership you can read it for FREE through the Kindle Owners Lending Library.Highly recommended!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Brilliantly conceived and executed horror novella&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1403568000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 24, 2014&quot;}</td>

Collins \&quot;Judith D Collins Must Read...&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [0, 0], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;A special thank you, to St. Martin&#39;s Press and NetGalley for an ARC in exchange for an unbiased and honest review.Loved everything about THE GLASS KITCHEN &amp;#8211; think sassy southern Texas, meets sophisticated demanding Upper West Side, filled with love of family and sisters, epicurean delights, life&amp;#8217;s lessons of forgiveness, and second chances. Delicious. . . absolutely delectable!As a child, Portia had a dream to run her grandmother&amp;#8217;s restaurant (The Glass Kitchen) in Texas; however, after settling for a different life (married to a senator which betrayed her with her best friend, and did not allow her to use her cooking talents); a life derailed, she finds herself divorced, and moving to Manhattan to join her two sisters, Olivia and Cordelia.Portia is sure she was responsible for her grandmother&amp;#8217;s untimely death and gives up her passion of cooking, due to this misconception. She inherited the ancestral gift (a knowing about events thru food), and her Gram instructed her how to use her abilities, leaving some helpful cookbooks and tips (how to heal certain illnesses with specific foods, among other things).Portia escapes Texas, and moves to the Upper West Side in a rundown brownstone townhome (garden lower level apartment), she inherits from her Great Aunt Evie, filled with fond childhood memories. However, she has no job skills and no divorce settlement (her first job was a hoot)! Her two sisters have sold their share of the townhome, to the handsome investment banker man who lives upstairs on the upper two floors (Gabriel Kane). The other two sisters are not without problems either.Gabriel lost his wife a year earlier, and is raising two daughters, Miranda (16) and Ariel (12, almost 13), and things are not going well in this household--total dysfunction and lack of communication. He wants to buy Portia&amp;#8217;s garden apartment; however, she does not want to sell as this is the only thing she owns.The last thing Portia wants is to get involved with a man and his daughters. She has problems of her own &amp;#8211; like how to survive in NYC! However, the minute she meets this man &amp;#8211; her food thoughts come back strong, and no matter how much she tries to escape, the more she is pulled into this world of food, cooking, and lust.However, fate steps in and forces Portia to do what she loves best in life &amp;#8211; COOKING, as a means to support herself &amp;#8211; working for handsome and complex Gabriel, while planning her test kitchen with the two sisters, sending aromas to the streets of NYC, while seeking investors for their desired new restaurant (The Glass Kitchen)--if they can find the capital. Some good comfort Texas food, gourmet style in for fast pace NYC&amp;#8212;putting her cooking skills to work to bring in the customers (and investors).Of course, to really make it yummy, nightly midnight visits (down the fire escape)to the garden level, from the complicated, hard nose, but sexy Gabriel, with some irresistible delights and surprises.All is not rosy and uncomplicated in this Upper West Side neighborhood. There are many twists, and obstacles along the way in this messy family of Kanes &amp;#8211;from Gabriel&amp;#8217;s mother, his brother Anthony, Gabriel&amp;#8217;s former wife, and mother of the girls, with a secret past and events leading to her death, which shake Ariel&amp;#8217;s world, as well as Portia.With quirky neighbors (Stanley and Marcus), supportive sisters, hot sex, some strong women, yummy gourmet recipes, love of food and recipes for life, with a young girl&amp;#8217;s determination to put her family back together, to one&amp;#8217;s woman&amp;#8217;s courage and journey to fulfillment and passion &amp;#8211; a meal you will want to savor!Linda Francis Lee created an irresistible banter and chemistry between Gabriel and Portia, which will keep you smiling and rooting for this sizzling, yet odd couple. And oh, Aerial will melt your heart, with her intelligence and winning personality, as she finds her way.There are many parallels here, and would be ideal for book clubs or discussions. Portia and Ariel, are very similar&amp;#8212;both are youngest of sisters, guilt ridden, undervalued by others for their intelligence, keen sense of humor, talent, style, and passion &amp;#8211;both courageous and determined to make things better, as they discover their true self.From the inviting front cover to the delectable and mouth-watering recipes &amp;#8211; a captivating novel of love, forgiveness, family, courage, and the determination to follow your heart and dreams.I was traveling while reading this book, and had to get up extra early, in order to finish THE GLASS KITCHEN, this morning before getting back on the road. Could not wait to see what would happen to these unforgettable and lovable characters. A five star winner! Looking forward to reading more from this insightful and talented author.If you are a fan of contemporary fiction, chick lit, romance, humor, southern women&amp;#8217;s fiction, love of gourmet food, and family dynamics, you will be assured to enjoy this magical novel, where life is not always perfect &amp;#8211; as the fun is in the &amp;#8220;messiness&amp;#8221;, with some courses and recipes to sweeten the deal.Fans of authors Sarah Pekkanen, Emily Giffin, Mary Kay Andrews, Sarah Rayner, Jane Green, Sarah Addison Allen, Susan Rebecca White, Mary Ellen Taylor, Joanne Demaio, Beth Hoffman, Nancy Thayer, Wendy Wax, Mary Simes, or Dorothea Benton Frank will find THE GLASS KITCHEN, fresh, irresistible, funny, and quite satisfying.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Loved everything about THE GLASS KITCHEN!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1403740800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 26, 2014&quot;}</td>

It is essentially split up into two parts, so I&amp;#8217;ll take it one at a time.Part 1:  The continuing battle with Uncle Aaron:While Miles and Aaron team up together at the beginning of the volume, they inevitably battle, as Aaron&amp;#8217;s blackmailing of Miles is finally resolved.  Frankly, I was shocked by how it was resolved.I haven&amp;#8217;t mentioned this in previous reviews, so I wanted to take this opportunity to say that I really like the fact that Miles&amp;#8217; power set is different than Peter&amp;#8217;s old power set.  Sure, there are some similarities, but then there are also some drastic differences.  The camouflage and venom blast are especially awesome.From here on out, there will be spoilers until I get to Part 2.  The death of Aaron was tragic and necessary.  As the Prowler, Aaron is a villain, and an enemy to Spider-Man.  The fact that he knows Miles&amp;#8217; secret identity means that he couldn&amp;#8217;t have stayed in the story unless he turned good.  Aaron wasn&amp;#8217;t on that trajectory, so he had to die, for the sake of the story and the character.  But how he died, accidentally being killed by his nephew, is so tragic for Miles, who now has to live with this as a 13 year old.  In an interest parallel, the death of Uncle Ben influenced the way Peter Parker would live as Spider-Man, and I&amp;#8217;m certain that the death of Uncle Aaron will impact the hero that Miles becomes.  Aaron&amp;#8217;s dying words, &amp;#8220;How about that?  You are just like me,&amp;#8221; will surely haunt Miles for years.  He will now have to look his father in the eyes knowing that he is responsible for the death of his father&amp;#8217;s brother.Part  2:  Working for Captain America:Although I&amp;#8217;m not reading any other Ultimate Marvel books, it is clear that there is a storyline going on in which some sort of war has started.  Captain America is leading the good guys, and Miles joins by their side.  This section, called &amp;#8220;Divided We Fall,&amp;#8221; opens with the words, &amp;#8220;Washington is decimated.  The government is a mess.  The Southwest is in chaos.  States are seceding from the union.  America is falling apart.&amp;#8221;  This sets the stage for Miles going to war, but not before an opening scene where Miles&amp;#8217; father tells him (Spoilers) the bad news that Spider-Man killed his uncle!Spoilers from here on out.  As with previous volumes, Peter&amp;#8217;s cast appears in Miles&amp;#8217; story.  In this volume, we get a crucial interaction as Aunt May and Gwen Stacy decide that it is time for Miles to have something that Peter built.  Web-shooters and the web formula!  I have to be honest, with all the other awesome powers that Miles had, I failed to realize that he didn&amp;#8217;t have the ability to go web-swinging.  This will be even better now!  Since Miles&amp;#8217; best friend, Ganke, is really smart, and knows his secret identity, he is tasked with the mission of creating the web fluid using Peter&amp;#8217;s formula.Ultimate Maria Hill makes an appearance in this volume, and quickly realizes a connection between Spider-Man and Miles&amp;#8217; family.Back in the war, chaos ensues, and Spider-Man is a big hero.  I really like it when Miles can work with Spider Woman (Peter&amp;#8217;s clone, but in female form), this volume had a lot of that.  Plus, there was further character development with Miles&amp;#8217; parents.  Another great Spider-Man book.I read this volume right after reading volumes 1 and 2, and it was a good experience to read the whole story (so far) straight through.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Spider-Man teams with the Ultimates as the United States are torn apart&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1389830400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 16, 2014&quot;}</td>

This is one of the best books I&#39;ve had the pleasure of reading, and I&#39;ve read thousands. There&#39;s not a lot I can say. These are the men and women who willingly offer to make the ultimate sacrifice every step of the way; patriotism at its finest. They live for the moment, protecting our freedom and security, sacrificing time with their families so that we may spend time with our families. I&#39;ll read anything from Scott McEwen if it&#39;s as good as this. I&#39;ve long been a Richard Marcinko fan and I&#39;ll now have to add Scott McEwen to my list of favorite authors.

It was well written I just think that the hero didn&#39;t act much like one in the beginning.  Griffon does grow on you as time goes on and I began to like Jade more too as the story progressed. As I got to the end of the book I realized what bothered me so much was the element of humiliation in it.  I love books with spanking and different kinds if discipline but humiliation is a turn off.  Too, there is a secondary story that has Griffon spanking Tasha and other employees. I prefer my stories to have a one man one woman spanking relationship.

Behind His Eyes - Truth is just another example of how Ms. Romig is at the top of her game and shows no signs of slowing down. Giving us Tony&#39;s POV is a huge treat, and helps us dive into the mind of this disturbingly, sexy, possessive man.In BHE - Truth, we are reminded, yet again, how powerful Anthony Rawlings really is. He is a man on a mission. He wants something he takes it. All throughout this story it&#39;s like you can hear him in your head, the anger, the desperation, everything this man feels, you are right there with him. Some might say we get so invested in this character, and we are so conflicted on how we feel about him, it can take a toll on us. I can certainly say, for a fact, that this series has taken a toll on me, in a bone-chilling, heart-racing, mind-****ing way, but I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way. These are the stories that stick with you long after you finish reading. It&#39;s what you start comparing all other books to. Nothing beats the raw emotion and intense feelings this series pulls out of you.Anthony Rawlings, Tony, Anton, Mr. Rawlings....no matter what you call this man, he will wreck you. He will make you hate him. He will make you feel sorry for him, and he will make you love him. This will go on and on, until you don&#39;t know what to think. No matter what you feel for him, the point is...you will FEEL.&amp;#10077;She was his drug. Claire Nichols ran through his system like ecstasy, sending him on otherwise unobtainable highs.&amp;#10078;In Behind His Eyes - Truth, Tony finally has to deal with circumstances beyond his control. That&#39;s not to say he won&#39;t try, but it&#39;s out of his reach. Conflicting feelings turn into clarity, and then to opportunity. Every little detail has it&#39;s reasoning. There are scenes that you appreciate getting a second look at. Maybe you will get some answers to some questions that have been on your mind. Maybe it will make you even more confused. No matter what, we get to see the two characters that we have fallen for happy again, even if for a moment in time. I&#39;m pretty sure I said this in my last review of BHE - Consequences, but if you are an avid reader of this series, even though you know what&#39;s going to happen, it is still so **** intense!I could seriously go on and on about Tony. He is so incredibly fascinating. Some of you while reading this will have little smirks on your face at times. We get to witness Tony without control. He always has such an internal conflict when it comes to his Claire. The depth of his feelings for Claire is beautiful, yet a little scary, but it&#39;s nice to bare witness to such a gruff man come to terms with his love for another human being. For such a powerful man he has so many regrets. It&#39;s a little sick that I find some comfort in his suffering, but it reminds us that he is just a man.&amp;#10077;He didn&#39;t want to be disappointed; however, more than that, he didn&#39;t want to disappoint.&amp;#10078;So make sure you pour yourself a glass of wine, shot of tequila, or a whiskey sour, because this will take a lot out of you. Nobody can write intensity like Aleatha Romig. She is so high at the top of her game right now, I can&#39;t wait to get the final chapter in this saga. Here is to another fantastic addition to the Consequences Series, and here is to the man we all love to hate, Mr. Anthony Rawlings.*Gifted Copy provided by the author in exchange for an honest review*&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Powerful, sexy, and thrilling!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1395100800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 18, 2014&quot;}</td>

I wish that there were more adult dystopian books but again this one is a Young Adult read. Not that I have anything against it but really someone needs to write an awesome Adult Dystopian novel!Divergent has been on my TBR (To be read) list for a long time and I was able to borrow this book from my friend finally and read it and I am so glad I finally was able to read this book! I am giving it 5 stars! Veronica Roth writes so well, there is no draggy parts at all, it has everything I could ask for. First of all, I think something that all dystopian books must have to be a good read is good action, during Tris&amp;#8217;s Initation in Dauntless she does a lot of gutsy things, she jumps on to and off of trains, jumps off buildings, and climbs the ferris wheel at the old Navy Pier and that is just naming a few, I won&amp;#8217;t tell you everything because I do not want to tell any spoilers. Roth also describes the landscape of Dystopian Chicago amazingly. I am obsessed with Chicago and have been there 3 times in the last 6 years to visit and the way she describes the places in Chicago and where Tris and her family and friends are at I can envision so clearly. There is also romance but not so much that it ruins the book and the meaning behind the book. Tris and Four are such a different couple then in most books I read and at the same time I can identify with them a little bit. I do not really have one bad thing to say about this book. If you like dystopian novels go out and try this one. I am looking forward to going with my co-blogger Colleen to see the movie so we can disect it and write a review of the book vs. the movie for everyone!Thanks always for reading!RochelleP.S.

I got the message that quitting sugar is hard, but I wanted more solutions to breaking the cycle. Perhaps I was again looking for the easy solution. In fact there is no easy way to lose weight. Other diets have proven that carb restriction usually suppresses cravings and the weight loss and health benefits have been widely publicized. I just didn&#39;t see much new in this approach. It wasn&#39;t badly written, didn&#39;t talk down to the reader, but just go in aware that carb restriction is the end goal.*I received my copy from NetGalley.com in exchange for an honest review.<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>overall<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-c1">3.0</span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>summary<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>Not My Favorite<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>unixReviewTime<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-c1">1391040000</span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>reviewTime<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>01 30, 2014<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>}</td>

Emily and Cassie own a Private Investigation firm together and have known each other since high school. They never kept secrets from each other until Emily heard a voice screaming her name in terror&amp;#8230; and a darkness began invading her mind.David is like the fox hiding sly. He is psychic also but uses his to prey on women. He believes Emily is his love and they are meant for each other. He is using his abilities to create a psychic link with Emily causing her to feel his evilness.How DO you hide from a killer who&amp;#8217;s in your mind?Emily must find out what the darkness is before it is too late. Conduit is the perfect read to get you completely enthralled. It is so hard to stop once started, it is always moving forward and drawing you into this dark world of David&amp;#8217;s. The amount of details given by the author and the wonderful way it was written causes heart pounding moments, fear of the dark and the need to check behind every closed door.

MYNSSSL is a perfect ending for this series!This review will be short because I don&amp;#8217;t want to mention any spoilers! But I loved that MNSSSL was written in two point-of-views &amp;#8211; Cat and Lucas. This was a great way to learn more about Lucas, who is a sweet and romantic guy! Lucas is also struggling with his relationship with his parents, so it is made clear the connection he has with Cat. It is truly fate that brings them together and they heal each other. MYNSSSL also focuses on Cat&amp;#8217;s insecurities because of her mom, which at times I did sympathize but also felt like throttling her. Rather than focusing on all the negative emotions as a result of her mom, Cat really needs to look around and see all the good she has. I loved seeing Alessandra (Less) and Austin make small appearances in the story, but I wish there was more of them. Less and Austin are comedic and I miss them! I also loved getting to know Jenna. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s because I am a mother of a teenager, but just seeing the bond Jenna and Cat have made was priceless.Overall I really enjoyed this book. This gives us closure for Cat&amp;#8217;s story but also left it wide open for a future spin-off (which I hope the author will do soon!!). The author&amp;#8217;s writing was perfect and I love the humor she adds to her story. This series is a fun and emotional ride, and I highly suggest this to everyone!!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Loved it!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1403395200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 22, 2014&quot;}</td>

I have been known to enjoy the serial books that are becoming a &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; but, I think this book would have been better off sitting a little bit longer and coming out as a full story and not pieced out. I feel that the serials are meant for very emotional, and raw stories. Fix You didn&#39;t accomplish that with me. It felt disjointed and very rushed. I could not bring myself to like the heroine, Olivia, she seemed childish, and naive. Whereas, Bash has so much riding on his job, and seemed to be a stand up guy for his family until Olivia makes him lose his head. It just didn&#39;t click with me. The story, the characters, their circumstances and their chemistry. Something just seemed off.That being said, Fix You does have the potential to grow into a book I would like to read. It did end on a mild cliffhanger which will probably intrigue me enough to move on to the second book. But the second serial is going to have to possess major growth where Olivia is concerned, and more explanation where her family is concerned, and build more on Bash and Olivia&#39;s relationship. The way part one ended, it just felt like a physical connection with no deeper meaning between the two.Again, I don&#39;t mind serials but they have to be done fantastically. This one was just so-so, and the fact that it was a serial on top of that just made it more frustrating than anything. I want to be left needing and wanting more. Fix You just left me perplexed and wanting it to have gone the extra mile and reach its potential. I sincerely hope this was just a slow start and then next parts in the book will rise to the occasion.Happy Reading!*ARC provided by the author/publisher via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review*&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 2.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;I really wanted to like it...&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1397606400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 16, 2014&quot;}</td>

He has interviewed hundreds of psychic-mediums, psychics and mediums.  He clearly explains the difference.  His explanation of what to expect in the spirit world is one of the best I have read.  Given that he was a lawyer and not the least interested in answers that couldn&#39;t be proven, then turned to this field and find it believable lend credibility to his beliefs.  It isn&#39;t easy to turn a non-beiever into a true spiritualist, but that he has done.  I respect his writing and intelligence.  I would recommend this to anyone who has lost a loved one.  Even if you haven yet had a major loss, this book will bring you great comfort.

I enjoyed the characters, their romance, and the storyline that Grace provided for us.Pacing: I felt this one was really well paced. Landon and Skye&#39;s relationship progressed quite well given their situation and Grace did a good job of keeping the story going without too many lulls or too much filler.Storyline: I really enjoyed this one. I do love the whole forbidden office romance going on and I liked that this storyline seemed to fall into place a bit more naturally than the first book in the series did. The story begins with Skye getting out of a messy potentially abusive relationship and starting a new job. She meets Landon Steele at a club one night and while she&#39;s not looking for anything more right now, she can&#39;t help the physical response he elicits from her. And then runs away. It made me chuckle because it sounds like something I would do! Unbeknownst to her, Landon is actually her new boss, which brings things to a whole new level of awkward and tense. Both know it would not be professional to have any kind of relationship, but staying away from one another is going to prove to be quite the task. Having to work closely together, it&#39;s only a matter of time before Landon and Skye give in. There was one obstacle thrown in I could have done without, as I felt it was added in to create more drama, which was unnecessary. There was already a more concrete storyline in place to add tension, and I felt that was good enough.Characters: I liked Skye and Landon. Skye is sweet and a bit of a seductress! She isn&#39;t actively looking to start anything else after getting out of her previous relationship, but things with Landon just happen and that kind of chemistry is just hard to ignore. She is close to her father and she doesn&#39;t want to do anything that will jeopardize his career, which is why she shoulders some things later in the novel on her own, instead of seeking help. She cares for Landon and doesn&#39;t want her mess disrupting his business, as he&#39;s worked hard to get where he is today.Landon is a great male lead. He&#39;s sexy, sweet, and dominant all in one. And man, do I love my dirty-talking boys! Landon could be a bit hard to read at times, but he is really a good guy who cares for Skye. He knows they should keep it professional, but working so closely with her does nothing to help his libido. Landon is very protective of Skye and he can&#39;t stand that her ex, Vic, hurt her. He refuses to watch another woman get crushed under the weight of a man, after seeing what his father did to his mother. He was the one to pick up the pieces and therefore, cannot let himself forgive his dad, despite his pleadings to see him and make things right.We also get to see Ellie, Mason, and Katie from Rumor Has It show up. Ellie and Katie are those girlfriends every girl needs in their life and I like that Grace included their friendship.Final Thoughts: Overall, I thought Picture Perfect was a great read. I liked seeing Skye and Landon&#39;s relationship develop slowly, as well as watch them fight the attraction they feel towards one another. Their scenes together were sexy and I didn&#39;t feel they were too over the top at all. There were a couple of things I could have done without, because I didn&#39;t feel they were necessary to fueling the plot. The storyline really did stand on its own, with their relationship, Skye&#39;s ex, and the matter of how important public appearance is to both of them.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Enjoyed the characters, their romance, and the storyline Grace provided for us.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1401753600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 3, 2014&quot;}</td>

Refusing to repent and name the partner in her sin, Rachel feels the wrath of the religious sect as she is shunned by those she loves most. She is eventually coerced into leaving by her brother-in-law, the bishop.But secrets run deep in this cloistered community, and the bishop is hiding some of his own, threatening his conscience and his very soul. When the life of Rachel&amp;#8217;s baby is at stake, however, choices must be made that will bring the darkness to light, forever changing the lives of those who call Copper Creek home.I was first drawn to this book by the cover.  I like reading novels about the Amish, as long as they aren&#39;t preachy, and from my experience they usually aren&#39;t.  However, this book was about Old Order Mennonites, which is a religion that I know very little about other then that they are similar to the Amish in their Plain ways.The Outcast is one of those rare novels that shines in many ways. I was immediately drawn in because &amp;#8220;The Scarlet Letter&amp;#8221; is such a favorite, and I was not disappointed. Every character, every sub-story, every generation, every relationship in the book, is layered and intricate and nuanced. The story seemed to start a little slow for me but once I was a few chapters in, I couldn&#39;t stop reading. Everything about the book took hold and wouldn&amp;#8217;t let go&amp;#8212;until I finished.  Even though the Mennonite community is completely foreign to me, Petersheim made it both fascinating but wholly accessible and familiar. In every scene I felt I was right there with her and every character.  Each word written had true meaning to the story.  There was very little that felt like filler.The story was written in two voices.  One was Amos who was Rachel&amp;#8217;s sister&#39;s recently deceased father-in-law and the other was Rachel&#39;s voice herself.  Amos&#39;s voice served as an omniscient voice for both of his son&#39;s, Tobias and Judah, as well as the moral compass for the story.  His words were used as a commentary on the happenings of the book.  At first I was worried that using a &amp;#34;ghost&#39;s voice&amp;#34; was going to be distracting to the story, it turned out that his voice was truly the perfect compliment to Rachel&#39;s and a unique way to give voice to the brother&#39;s without devoting more chapters to each brother.  Petersheim&#39;s use of this device shows that she is going to continue to be a fantastic writer.  For an author to write in such a unique and difficult manner shows her writing maturity which will only grow the more that she writes.  One other complaint is that the book ended a little too quickly and I wish there was more information on how the book ending came to be and what happened to the family after everything finally settled down.  I would love to see a sequel to this novel because I was so wrapped up in the characters that I feel like they are real people to me.I highly recommend this book to others.  Give the book a chance and keep reading if you feel like the beginning is slow or confusing.  The author does a good job of sorting things out for the reader as the story goes on.  This would be a 5 stars book for me but I want to hold back a little because of the confusing beginning and the abrupt ending.  This is a solid 4.5 stars!  Enjoy the read!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;A wonderful debut!  This author is going somewhere!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1390176000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 20, 2014&quot;}</td>

Yes, the Supreme Court in a limited decision came down on the side of the Sacketts that they should receive a formal review, but there was much more to the story. Readers should check the Harvard Law review of this case before accepting Box&#39;s view.

I will say if you liked Fifty, you will probably like this series as well , but it&#39;s not fair to the author to say that it&#39;s &amp;#34;just like&amp;#34; that other,I certainly didn&#39;t think so! Better to come into this series with an open mind and just let it happen.Of course, Hudson is a rich, demanding a$$ who doesn&#39;t believe in love. Of course, Alayna is a smart, beautiful woman with issues of her own. This is a romance novel, and the majority of romance novels I have read are based on this premise, it is the skill of the author that makes each story special and engaging, and why I keep reading them. I DO like stories with broken, flawed, beautiful protagonists, with plenty of chemistry and steamy sex, and this series has that-in spades!

His panoramic and in-depth view of the people and the events made his Histories a comprehensive study that is rare in history. And he was a master storyteller too. The story he was telling here was the complex political disputes and long standing social feuds between Greek cities and Asian peoples that culminated in the Greco-Persian Wars.Of course any translated book is only as good as the translator and the editor. This happens to be an excellent one because neither the translator nor the editor tried to show off their classical Greek training or their convoluted scholarly skills. They simply presented this book in smooth and clear English which made the reading easy without the undue burden of constantly referring to the notes. In addition, the series of maps at the end of the book was immensely helpful.Traditional historians tend to take a serious and rigid position on their view of history as if it&#39;s the only perspective. Recently, some historians have tried to open up this narrow scope and try to interpret history from different points of view and have proclaimed their approach \&quot;new history\&quot;. But Herodotus had beaten them to it because that&#39;s exactly what his Histories did.Even though he was writing for the Greeks, he showed great appreciation and understanding of Egyptian history and culture and often gave Egypt credit for many ideas and inventions later given to the Greeks. He also showed remarkable respect for their archenemy the Persians. In fact, a lot of our information of the early Achaemenids came from his writings. His open-mindedness and international outlook is astonishing. However, he couldn&#39;t resist giving Greek ancestors to the non-Greeks. Thus the Persians were descended from Perseus, the Medians from Medea, and the Egyptians from Io.Even though Herodotus lived in a city sponsored by Athens during the Peloponnesian Wars, he didn&#39;t seem to like the Athenians very much and praised the Spartans very generously. He tried to give dues and disclose warts when he talked about the conflicts between Greek city-states, personal vendettas among the leaders, reasons for frequent defections, and the wide spread collaborations between the Greeks and the Persians throughout this period. Not surprisingly, even though the Spartans helped the Athenians defeat the Persians in this round, two generations later, the Persians helped the Spartans defeat the Athenians.As this was a time before the fanatical intolerant monotheism took over the region and religious tolerance was the norm, Herodotus told the readers \&quot;their Zeus is called XXX \&quot; or \&quot;their religious rite is similar to our XXX\&quot; to relate foreign practices to Greek understanding. However, he wisely and steadfastly refused to engage in religious discussions beyond the necessary mentions of it as part of the cultural and political practice because he deemed it outside his chosen topics of history, geography, and culture.Some scholars complained that his writing was rambling but I find it very natural. He introduced each player when it was appropriate in the story and not before. He revealed each people, their history, their location, their customs, and their achievements as the flow of storytelling required.  By disclosing their origins and struggles, he gave roots to their unique culture and made their way of life reasonable and understandable. He was a master storyteller who knew when and how to take excursions and when and how to get back on track. With imperceptible forward momentum, he unrolled the story slowly and even-handedly towards its dramatic climax.Herodotus sprinkled a lot of traditional oriental wisdom, as dispensed by various wise men from different race, throughout the book. But it&#39;s often the small anecdotes which are most intriguing and lighten the reading. And some of the passing remarks are more than first meets the eyes. For example, his observation that the Egyptians had thick skulls because they shaved their heads and the Persians had thin skulls because they had long hair and wore felt hats is unexpectedly modern understanding of vitamin D from the sun thickens bones. And the bit about Xerxes&#39; uncle explaining that dreams are not messages from gods but things we have been concerned about during the day is also surprisingly modern Jungian.Most impressively, he did not insist on his point of view. He shared other perspectives and other interpretations equally, even those information and stories he did not find credible. As he said \&quot;I am obliged to record the things I am told but I am not required to believe them.\&quot; He trusted the readers to make their own choice among various versions.  Some scholarly historians called this gossiping, but I thought it was respect for the readers. After all, there are many sides to every person, many facets to every event, and many explanations to every outcome.Even though the West has taken the position that the Greeks had won because of the naval victory at Salamis, it was not so simple. Considering that the Persians had demolished Attica and burned Athens, and considering that Xerxes returned home when winter was coming, one could conclude that the Persian&#39;s expedition to punish Athens for helping the Ionians and for burning Sardis was mission accomplished. Besides, Persia was never a sea power like the Greeks were anyway. So, win or lose, it all depends on the spin!On the other hand, Herodotus did have the advantage of living in a highly cultured and civilized world of Eastern Mediterranean and was writing for a sophisticated and educated readership.  Later scholarly historians didn&#39;t have his advantage because they were living in the Western Mediterranean world after the onset of the devastating Dark Age and after it was under the intolerant grip of Christianity. Besides, his gift for storytelling is unique even among fiction writers much less among historians.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Far Away and Long Ago Came Alive!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1388793600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 4, 2014&quot;}</td>

Just. So. Beautiful.Okay, now that I got that out of my system, let me just say that this was not what I was expecting AT ALL. The writing was beautiful. Lauren&#39;s inner monologues were beautifully written, although this girl annoyed me to no end. But I love characters who frustrate me. Isn&#39;t that the point? As the reader, I have the foresight/foreknowledge that Lauren doesn&#39;t so my frustrations with her weren&#39;t because she wasn&#39;t likable. I was frustrated because I was able to see the disaster coming (although, I COMPLETELY wasn&#39;t expecting it to be what it was) and she couldn&#39;t.I tried, but I just couldn&#39;t get myself to like Cal. Even after his whole secret was revealed, it didn&#39;t change how utterly repulsed I was by the way he treated Lauren. And then Lauren frustrated me further by defending him. By waiting for him. By putting her life on hold for him.She and Caylen deserve so much better. In the sequel, I really hope she and Chris get to know each other and fall for one another somehow, some way. I don&#39;t know why I feel that way since we didn&#39;t get to read much about Chris. I just do. Hopefully we&#39;ll have more insight into who he is in the next book.The suspense element of this story had me flipping pages and reading until the wee hours of the morning. I&#39;m completely dragging my ass at work right now because of it. (Thanks a lot, Portia.) This book was suspenseful right down to the last page, and did I mention how beautiful Portia&#39;s writing is? Oh, I did? Well, that&#39;s okay because it was worth a second mention.I gave this book five stars because it was beautifully written. It sucked me in from the first page and held me all the way to the last, and after reading so many different books, I hardly ever read books straight thru anymore without getting bored. I don&#39;t remember the last time I devoured a book in just one sitting, but I did with this one. I couldn&#39;t put it down! This book was nothing I was expecting, but everything I needed. It was different, a breath of fresh air, although it was extremely, frustratingly moving at times.On the fence about one-clicking? Just do it. You won&#39;t be disappointed.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Excellent Debut!

I have a few thoughts I&#39;d like to share in my review.Characters: Demi was a strong, ballsy woman who wouldn&#39;t back down from the truth, no matter how much easier it would make her life. Jack was a mysterious, sexy guy but his role was not in enough focus for me. I think the balance of their fling/affair/whatever it was was pretty unrealistic and too... quick.I was disappointed with how quickly the story ended and feel like there needed to be more. By that point, I was rooting for more, more, more. I&#39;d love to read more by this author, maybe even a follow up on Demi and Jack&#39;s story.<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>overall<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-c1">3.0</span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>summary<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>Great read, too short!<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>unixReviewTime<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-c1">1399161600</span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>reviewTime<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>05 4, 2014<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>}</td>

I had to see what would happen and what it would take for Mitch to come around and do right by Paige and his daughter.This book takes place approximately 7 months from the conclusion of the first novella. Believe it or not Mitch has not been home since he left and it takes a threatening document to stir him in to action.When back in town he wastes no time trying to establish a relationship with his daughter. Paige initially is shocked, then angered, then finds herself melting under the charms of Mitch. It is obvious the two still have feelings for each other.Both families have been very supportive of Paige and Bree. Everyone except Diane is leery of Mitch&#39;s actions regarding Paige. As one would guess the two find their way back to each other.I want to state that I love Kendall&#39;s writing and I was anxiously awaiting this book. Mitch does truly seem remorseful but I can&#39;t say I am happy with the ending. He screwed up in a major way, HUGE. I am ok with him trying to establish a relationship with Bree, but I cannot see how Paige gets past the abysmal way he treated her. Even when trying to work hard to get her back, the only thing that is conveyed crystal clear is his attraction and desire for Paige. Everything is very physical. His actions with Bree obviously are great but I don&#39;t see how he made any amends to Paige. Humbling himself with her family and Erin seemed inadequate and I really wish Paige sought something better.Then the crazy twist at the end, I knew something was fishy but I didn&#39;t have any clue it was gonna go down like it did. Not sure how I feel about that as it was thrown in last minute and not really dealt with. I am curious to read the next book however to see what happens between Josh and Erin.So overall, great writing, good story and characters which are believable. I just couldn&#39;t make peace with the whole situation though which is probably a personal issue. Plus what is up with Trent. I wonder if we will ever get his whole story.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Loved the writing!!!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1404864000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;07 9, 2014&quot;}</td>

I loved the continuation and conclusion of Ben &amp; Emmy&amp;#8217;s story picking right up where Working It left off. At the end of Working It I was DYING, I needed to know if my Ben and Emmy were going to make it. Could they work through their issues? Could they accept the paternity results of Fiona&amp;#8217;s pregnancy? These were the questions I needed answers to&amp;#8230;desperately! And thank goodness all of my questions were answered but not without a few bumps along the way. Kendall upped the angst here which I loved and she also upped Ben&amp;#8217;s sweet romantic side which had me swooning with a capital S. I&amp;#8217;m telling you, he went over and above to not only tell Emmy how he felt about her, he showed her as well. I loved him! I also liked seeing how Emmy lost a bit of her naivet&amp;eacute;, she was still our sweet caring girl, BUT she no longer let Fiona push her around. She stood her ground when it came to her and her underhanded comments &amp; usual Fiona nastiness. She put her in her place. If I could, I&amp;#8217;d high five Emmy.All in all I think Craving Him was a sweet, sexy (this is Kendall after all, she&amp;#8217;s a master of sexy) conclusion for Ben &amp; Emmy and I can&amp;#8217;t wait for All or Nothing, Ellie and Braydon&amp;#8217;s story, due out in September &amp;#60;3&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Sweet, Sexy Conclusion to Ben &amp; Emmy&#39;s Story!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1402963200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 17, 2014&quot;}</td>

BUT This Novel Succeeds Brilliantly! It is Superlative and the Author here is a Master Artist at the Top of both his game and his Genre. Most of us don&amp;#8217;t have close relationships with dashing heroes named or brilliant, beautiful female femme fatales who light up the Kindle or paper page in front of us. This makes it tempting to take inspiration from people we actually know. But this Fantastic book does everything for you! The resulting characters are Magnificent Creations here and not the thinly veiled versions of ourselves, our friends, and relatives. The Author is asking readers to visualize the characters and relate to them. They want the characters to be realistic so that the audience can connect to them. This Superlative Novel makes the reader want to cheer them on as they surmount obstacles and shed a tear when they fall. Gustav Freytag considered plot a narrative structure that divides a story into five parts, like the five acts of a play. These parts are the exposition (of the situation), rising action (through conflict), climax (or turning point), falling action and resolution. This book which grabbed my attention from the very first page to the very last is a masterful example of a perfectly created plot. I read the novel in one sitting! It was that good! Highly recommended! Great Buy! You will thoroughly enjoy it! Beautiful Post APOCALYPTIC SAGA That will Enthral you.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Fantastic and Engrossing Post Apocalyptic Saga.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1404259200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;07 2, 2014&quot;}</td>

I would recommend reading the other two books first since Pesh Nadeem appears in The Proposal, so the story makes more sense if you know his background. Megan McKenzie is a single mom who is in the final stages of becoming a registered nurse. She hasn&#39;t dated since her son&#39;s father left her when she found out she was pregnant. Pesh is an ER doctor who hasn&#39;t dated seriously since the death of his wife years ago. You would think they would want the same thing in a relationship...love and commitment, but you would be very wrong. Megan wants a hot fling, and Pesh wants to settle down and give love another try. They are both chosen as godparents to Aidan and Emma&#39;s son, Noah. Pesh is a great friend to them, and Megan is Aidan&#39;s niece. When they meet at the baptism, there is an immediate attraction between the two, but it&#39;s going to be a battle of the wills to see which one gets their way, a relationship or just hot, smoldering sex! Megan leaves the reception with Pesh after she has too much to drink, and she thinks she will be having a night of hot sex with the sexy doctor, but things don&#39;t turn out quite like she had hoped. The two go their separate ways the next morning, but fate isn&#39;t through with these two, Megan is assigned to Pesh&#39;s ER to finish her final clinicals several months later. Let the games begin again...you&#39;ll have to read on to see if Megan or Pesh win.I have read the other two books in the series and loved them. I know reading reviews from other readers that many of them didn&#39;t like Pesh in The Proposal because they thought he was trying to take Emma away from Aidan. However, I have always been a fan of Pesh&#39;s. Who wouldn&#39;t be! He&#39;s sexy as hell, a successful doctor, a truly honorable soul, and again did I mention sexy as hell? He falls for Megan hard the first time he sees her and cannot forget about her. Megan is a firecracker. If you read any of the other books, you know she takes after her Uncle Aidan. She and Pesh are truly opposites who complement each other nicely. Megan brings out the spontaneous side of Pesh, and he brings out the softer side of her. There are many scenes that include Megan&#39;s toddler son, Mason. Those were some of the most heart-warming scenes to me, especially the one near the end of the book when they are eating dinner with Megan&#39;s family. Much of the story is about Pesh&#39;s pursuit of Megan and trying to get her to give him a chance at a real relationship. The sexy stuff doesn&#39;t happen until at least mid-way through the book, but it was well worth the wait. Katie knows how to write a sexy love scene!One of my favorite things about this book is that I got to see how Aidan, Emma, and many of the other characters are doing. I love Aidan and Megan&#39;s big Irish family! The epilogue was sweet and tied up things very nicely. I have read almost everything by Katie Ashley, and she has yet to disappoint me!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Sweet, Sexy Love Story&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1393200000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 24, 2014&quot;}</td>

Once again, everything seemed almost sugar coated and sort glossed over.******** SPOILER ALERT ********DO NOT CONTINUE IF YOU HAVEN&#39;T ALREADY READ THIS BOOK!Okay, so here are some of the specific issues that I had with the plot in Honor &amp; Obey / Honor &amp; Betray:1) What the hell ever actually happened to Abby? She was just one of many things that got brushed aside and never revisited.2) I can&#39;t possibly be the only one to think that the amnesia was a complete writing cop out (sorry Teresa, I love your work and really do think you&#39;re a fantastic author)!! I mean, COME ON! I was so damn intrigued to see how they would work through all of the craziness that, surely Emma was bound to find out about William. But I knew that somehow William would find a way to convince her that he really loves her, and win her back over, and their relationship would prove to be better and stronger in the end... Unfortunately, Emma STILL DOESNT KNOW THE TRUTH!3) William&#39;s parents. They rushed to his beside when they found out he was in a coma, brought in some phenomenal specialist doctor to work with him, then just peaced out and were never heard from again. Emma didn&#39;t bother to inform him that they had been there, nor did he bother to ask, and also, nobody bothered to even freakin&#39; tell them that he was awake and at home, and his parents didn&#39;t even bother to so much as call to check on him either!!4) Emma was harboring so much hurt &amp; resentment towards William through most of the book, and then *BAM* like the flip of a switch she&#39;s.over.it.and.they&#39;re.getting.married.THE.END there was no actual working through her hurt, no communication, openness, honesty. So now they got their &amp;#34;HEA&amp;#34; that seems doomed because their whole relationship is based on lies &amp; deceit between 2 people who are trying too hard to be what they think that the other wants, rather than being who they really are.With all that being said, the series was good, and had TONS of potential for greatness, but the last 2 books were just too rushed and had too many holes in the plot.Also, I would have very much preferred to read the 2 books together, just written as 1 book, done in alternating POV&#39;s.Wow, that was really long winded, if you&#39;ve stuck it out and are still reading this, thank you!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;SO.MUCH.POTENTIAL!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1402099200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 7, 2014&quot;}</td>

I really enjoyed the premise of arranged marriage and the two warring countries trying to establish peace and unity. I liked the different customs of the two countries and how both Gabrielle and Alec had to overcome their dislike for each other. I liked their relationship and the way things turned out in the end.The things I didn&#39;t like were pretty much the same as the first book. I felt like an observer of the story, as the characters go about their lives without much detail. While it had a nice, sweet feel to it, I felt like I was constantly being told, rather than shown, the characters&#39; emotions.That being said, the book is very clean, enjoyable, and quick to read. It is suitable for teen and adult readers.Content: Clean<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>overall<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-c1">4.0</span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>summary<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>Clean fantasy romance<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>unixReviewTime<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-c1">1399593600</span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>reviewTime<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>05 9, 2014<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>}</td>

But everything is about to change for both Danny and Skylar as they go off to start college together.&amp;#34;...When I kiss you for the first time, it&#39;s going to be one of those kisses that you&#39;re going to try to top for the rest of your life, but nothing will come close.

Danny has finally won the girl, and she just so happens to be the girl who completely steals his heart. Through out the four years of college, Danny and Mira build a beautiful relationship together.  Skylar and Mira become extremely close friends and Kylee is the little sister type friend who helps keep them all together.

I was left on the edge of my seat wanting to know what will happen next. And as much as I want to know , I&#39;m happy she took the time to give us Danny&#39;s POV.  You learn a lot more about Danny and Mira&#39;s relationship in this novella.  But you also get an understanding of how close Mira and Skylar become as well. I can not wait to read Awakening and see what happens next with these four amazing characters.  I absolutely adore this series and give Inception a Nerd Alert A+ or 5 stars!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Fall in love. ...again&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1395360000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 21, 2014&quot;}</td>

We can be fluid, flexible when we have to be. But strong and destructive too. And something else, I think to myself. Like water, we mostly follow the path of least resistance.&amp;#8221;Seeing as Wally Lamb is my favorite author I was extra excited to read this book. It definitely did not disappoint. On the surface, this is a story of a broken marriage. Of a wife and mother of three who leaves her husband for another woman. If you have read some of his previous works, you already know that there is going to be so much more to the story. Pour yourself a large glass of red wine and keep the bottle nearbyThere are so many heavy issues that are dealt with in this story, divorce, sexual abuse, loss of a parent, alcoholism, the list goes on. I know this makes it sound like a depressing story but it&amp;#8217;s not all bad. The real heart of the story is learning to cope with what life has given you and making the most of it. Buy another bottle of wine.The thing I love the most about his novels is the way everything is so layered. You have to pay attention to things that may seem insignificant at the time as it will certainly come full circle in the end. There is always some intertwined story that seems to not have anything to do with the rest until the end. This is not to say that everything gets tied up and placed in a nice package with a bow on it. Many things are just inferred and if you haven&amp;#8217;t been paying attention you will miss out on these gifts.Annie Oh is an artist, a mother, and an ex wife and is about to be remarried. To a woman. Her husband Orion is left to deal with not only being left but being left for another woman. Their children are also forced to deal with aftermath of her decisions. Annie also has secrets from her childhood that have shaped everything she has ever done in her adult life. Things she has never shared with anyone. Not even her husband or her soon to be wife. Of course this only begins to scratch the surface of the entire plot of the story.This novel reminds me of the concept of the butterfly effect. One small action effects so many things. It is not until the end that we learn what started everything. I can honestly say there is not one thing I disliked about this story.

Beth and Gabriel&#39;s story continues in this action packed erotic romance, with all the emotional twists and outside surprises Towers is known for.The book opens with Beth trying to adjust to her new life as the billionaire&#39;s girl. It&#39;s a strange, wonderful world filled with incredible luxuries that would make any waitress&#39; eyes pop. The lavish socials and high powered business dealings that are normal for Gabriel are a complete shock to Beth, and she struggles to integrate into his world. Of course, it helps to have tall, dark, and handsome making things a little easier for her, with plenty of moments to blow off steam.As in most Towers romances, outside forces try to come in and disrupt the happy couple. This book has plenty of wild intrusions, schemes, and deadly misunderstandings that left me guessing until the joyous end!The little things in this novel brought a smile to my face as well. A couple characters from her other books make cameos in this novel. Then there are the genuinely heartfelt moments between Beth and the billionaire where it seems nothing could ever tear them apart, even when it feels like the whole world is aligned against them.If you like your romances HOT with a little mystery and a strong Coming of Age element, then this book is for you!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Another Cup of Romance Win From Towers!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1391817600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 8, 2014&quot;}</td>

The savory dishes with Chocolate (Chocolate-Rubbed Baby Back Ribs, Beef &amp; Been Chili with Three Chocolates, etc.) were a nice surprise.

I also read the beginning, how the author was a busy mom who worked a night shift, trained Crossfit, and cooked for her family of four so I thought there would be a lot of easy practical recipes.I was disappointed to find that most of the recipes had a lot of ingredients, something the author complained about in other books. Many of the ingredients in recipes were also other recipes from the book, so for instance a chicken recipe may have 12 ingredients, one of which is bacon aioli which is 8 ingredients and another is cauliflower rice which is time consuming as well.I also wasn&#39;t crazy about the type of recipes. I&#39;m looking for practical everyday meals, and I keep finding paleo books that try to recreate gourmet restaurant quality meals. The author is an admitted &amp;#34;foodie&amp;#34; and it shows. She lives in San Francisco and is a part of that restaurant scene, and she flies to cities or other countries just to try a restaurant. I don&#39;t do any of that. I&#39;m just looking for stuff I can make for my family that&#39;s easy and good. I feel as though she wrote this book for people like her and not people like me, but I guess I should have been more careful when buying.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 2.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Very pretty but not practical for a busy person&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1390348800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 22, 2014&quot;}</td>

Shelley MunroReview from Jeannie Zelos Book reviews.So, in the mood for a straight romance I chose this. Its a romance, and also a puzzle with danger coming to Kate along with the solution.I liked Kate, she&#39;s mum to her dead sister&#39;s child, and she and Jamie have carved out a contented life for themselves. Then their world is turned upside down when tabloid papers print a story over Jamie being local hero and rugby player Lane&#39;s son. Of course as always they&#39;re not interested in the truth &amp;#8211; just want scandal for the ratings. Kate is bombarded with Press at her home, Lane completely blind sided by the fact he may have a ten year old child, and Jamie struggling with insecurity wondering if he&#39;ll be taken from Kate...Kate&#39;s firm and insistent, nothing will take him away from her, though she&#39;s willing to let Lane build a relationship with him.Along the journey to the truth there&#39;s  a potential kidnapping, danger and attacks on Kate&amp;#8217;s home and business, and threats to her safety. Lane steps up his protection of her and gradually falls in love. He just needs to persuade Jamie and Kate that they should be a family.Its a fun romance with a snippet of danger, not heart stopping but a more subtle kind that creeps up quietly and lands with a bang. The police were great characters too, becoming regular visitors. The protagonist didn&#39;t really come as a shock to me, but it was well done, and everything added up &amp;#8211; I hate when we find out who the &amp;#8220;baddie&amp;#8221; is and it doesn&amp;#8217;t fit the clues we&#39;ve had, none of that here though. Looking back we can see how things build up to that dramatic climax and reveal.Priced at 0.99 for 228 pages its long enough to let the reader get into the plot. Its a bargain for lovers of gentle contemporary romance.Stars: Four, fun read but a one off for me.ARC supplied by Netgalley&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;sweet HEA romance&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1395964800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 28, 2014&quot;}</td>

Stance, grip, plane, tempo, follow-through. . . whew.  It&#39;s a wonder that anyone even enjoys the game enough to bother trying to track everything.  &amp;#34;Golf Flow&amp;#34; offers a truly unique perspective on improving your game and your enjoyment of the game by focusing on the mental aspects of the game.  As others have also mentioned, these competitive principles also could be applied to broader applications such as other sports, your work, etc.  Will it shave strokes off of your score?  Honestly, probably not (only practice makes possible in my opinion), but it definitely will enable you to receive greater enjoyment out of your time spent on the course.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Simplifies Your Game - Leads to More Enjoyment&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1395273600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 20, 2014&quot;}</td>

Kresley Cole is capable of telling a great story filled with humor, action, and romance. That said...1. I had put off reading this book due to the book price coinciding with hardcover price. If I had paid HC price for this, it would have been a 1.2. I know the hero was tortured and all but he heaped abuse on the heroine. Paranormal elements aside, if she were a friend, I&#39;d subtly be showing her how unhealthy the relationship is and trying to convince her to end it.3. This book doesn&#39;t the have the laugh-out-loud moments and one-liners that previous ones did.4. I&#39;m afraid this series is in decline.  We&#39;re moving the grand plot along by pushing out meh stories. This happens I guess--I&#39;ve actually thought the same about another paranormal series I follow. I wish the authors would quit while ahead and leave us with good memories of good books with good characters.I do hope KC keeps writing. Maybe she can recreate her special brand of magic in a new project. I haven&#39;t read her YA series yet. Now, I have mixed feelings about starting on that.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 2.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Abuse outweighs romance in relationship&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1388966400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 6, 2014&quot;}</td>

Palen Jr. \&quot;Ray\&quot;&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [1, 1], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;This novel was initially released in 1996 and has been re-released now for two reasons.  The first of which is the fact that the author, Magdalen Nabb, passed away in 2007 and it is an opportunity to continue having her work presented to a new legion of readers.The second reason is the recent revival in this true crime cold case that has brought about a non-fiction novel (with the same title) that was co-written by Douglas Preston and Mario Spezi.  That book has garnered interest from Hollywood and a film is speculated to be made starring George Clooney in the role of Doug Preston!The Monster Of Florence was the Jack the Ripper of Italy having been charged with seven double homicides between 1968 and 1985. There were many other murders that could have possibly been committed by this individual but local law enforcement has been unable to prove any of that.  Actually, they have not been able to prove anything and this remains the most infamous cold case in Italian history.Along comes Magdalen Nabb attempting to put a fictional spin on this case.  Her recurring crime series that featured Marshal Guarnaccia is the perfect outlet for a speculative novel about the famed Monster of Florence.  Like the actual officials following this case, Guarnaccia seems to be foiled at every turn and is surprised when his Director assigns him the task of reopening an old cold case such as this one.The novel contains many court transcripts and internal communications that reviewed the various suspects in this case --- and there are a lot of them.  Nabb blends both fictional and non-fictional suspects to present a case for Guarnaccia that appears overwhelming for anyone to solve.If readers have read the non-fiction novel by Preston &amp; Spezi they will realize how inept, corrupt and misguided the Italian law enforcement and legal communities were in regards to this case.  Preston and Spezi themselves were even detained and briefly accused of being the Monster themselves!  A frustrating endeavor for anyone seeking to bring clarity and understanding to this case.THE MONSTER OF FLORENCE provides a lot of technical detail that at times bogs down the action and pace of the novel.  The main enjoyment in reading a novel like this rests in having an understanding of the actual case it was based on and appreciating the attempt to shine some light on a dark chapter in Italian history.Reviewed by Ray Palen for New Mystery Reader&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Fictional take on an infamous Italian cold case.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1389225600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 9, 2014&quot;}</td>

It talks about being fearful of sleep paralysis and how meditation plus lucid dreaming helps to archive astral travel.The reason I&#39;m giving it a 1 star is because the most critical element, according to the book, to actually being able to project, requires  &amp;#34;sleep paralysis&amp;#34;, and the book spends almost no time at all on how to achieve it.Here&#39;s a section on sleep paralysis:&amp;#34;Is there a way to activate or consciously create sleep paralysis? I haven&amp;#8217;t found a way to consciously induce it, however, there are several conditions which almost always lead to sleep paralysis. One is being on your back. Another is coming out of a lucid dream. And the third is taking a nap or going back to sleep in the middle of the night after you&amp;#8217;ve been up for a short while.&amp;#34;Here&#39;s the passage indicating that sleep paralysis is critical to the process of astral projection:&amp;#34;The big moment has arrived. You&amp;#8217;ve achieved sleep paralysis, your body is tingling, you hear the buzzing high-pitched sound of acceleration. You can see even though your eyes are closed, you&amp;#8217;re sensing, seeing, and hearing other beings around you. Your astral body is activated&amp;#34;In other words, without sleep paralysis I cannot astral project, and the book really doesn&#39;t spend any time on how to get me there. This was not helpful for me. Am I missing something?

But not even close. I don&#39;t plan to read the 2nd book in the series.The main characters are a mom and her two daughters- Joanna, Ingrid and Freya. They live in mythical North Hampton LI, near Gardiners Island. They have been forbidden to use their powers since the Salem Witch trials, but they find themselves tempted when things in their town start getting strange. Freya is struggling to decide between two men, librarian Ingrid is too staid, and Joanna just wants to mother the housekeeper&#39;s son. I found the characters interesting, but the plot line got a bit random and overdone (for me) with the mythology, underworld, vampire and zombie popping up. I would have liked this better with just the lighthearted white magic (like the Accidental Witch series).&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Not a big fan of \&quot;witch books\&quot; and this didn&#39;t change my mind&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1404172800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;07 1, 2014&quot;}</td>

This book does a great job of delving more deeply into the betrayal that Voyager suffers from the hands of a Starfleet ship and crew--which can only be called treason and attempted murder. Getting a better understanding of this betrayal and the deep pain Janeway feels for having trusted Ransom and (in the process) having put Voyager in danger helped me be a bit more forgiving for her over-the-top reaction. I am not a fan of all episode rewrites, but this is one of the best I&#39;ve read. If you like Voyager or if you are upset by Janeway&#39;s treatment of Noah Lessing in the episode, this book is a great study of the plot&#39;s main conflict. I highly recommend it and have read it multiple times!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Great episode rewrite&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1393804800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 3, 2014&quot;}</td>

It&#39;s wonderfully illustrated, there&#39;s enough colour and pictures interspersed throughout to appeal to younger ages, but not to the point of being extremely juvenile so it can grow with them. This is a full version of the Bible, in the New International Readers Version (NIrV) which is a translation that uses contemporary english. I find it similar to the NIV.This Bible is hardcover, which is a big plus for durability. We have had one or two other Junior Bibles around here and the soft cover ones do not stand up well to regular use and going back and forth to church. The pages aren&#39;t super thin, I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll be likely to rip and the print doesn&#39;t leak right through making it hard to read. That seems to be a problem with some other children&#39;s Bibles because they are trying to do things cheap. Not a problem here. The only negative I have about this particular Bible is the lenticular picture on the front of the bible, the ribbed 3D kind of thing. I think it makes it look younger than it&#39;s really geared for and the age that would be ready for a full Bible. Besides that, young boys love scratching their nails across it!Overall, this is a great Bible choice for a boy or girl who is ready for a full Bible instead of a Bible story book. It&#39;s already got my 7 year old reading bits and pieces in his new Bible instead of feeling like it&#39;s way out of his league. It&#39;ll be a while before he&#39;s reading whole chapters but he feels grown up having this Bible.This Bible was provided to me by Zondervan and BookLook for the purpose of an honest review. My opinion is my own.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Pleasantly surprised by the quality of this Bible!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1404086400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 30, 2014&quot;}</td>

Sometimes she isn&amp;#8217;t sure she&amp;#8217;s heard right, but she continues to have faith.Set in the 1950s in rural western Pennsylvania, the plot pits Emeline against arrogant tormentors who view her as only a commodity. Even Deet, the sole member of the Hardgrave family to show her kindness and help, has his own agenda.Shortly after heeding the voice and marrying Angus Hardgrave to escape a stalking rapist her faith is tested as never before. Angus is brutal and demanding. He seizes her bank account and property and conspires to engage in dog-fighting and moon-shining with her stalker.Angus, a man more than twice her age and with an evil reputation, is also moving to the direction of a voice&amp;#8212;one definitely not divine. The voice he obeys spews hatred, selfishness and prescriptions for violence.Emeline proves a brave woman, capable of enduring more than expected in this gritty novel with characters reminiscent of Faulkner. This is not a work for those offended by violence and harsh language. But if you&amp;#8217;re willing to look beyond those obstacles you&amp;#8217;ll find it an engrossing and memorable story.The conflict between good and evil is never clear-cut, but in this novel it is absolute.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Rural Noir&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1390780800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 27, 2014&quot;}</td>

BETTER HOMES &amp; HAUNTINGS is a departure from Harper&amp;#8217;s normal vampires, werewolves, and witches, but it doesn&amp;#8217;t suffer for it. In fact, this standalone was  a treat, and definitely worth the read despite my complaints about tropes.There were some truly creepy moments in BETTER HOMES &amp; HAUNTINGS. Between the ghostly experiences, plus the &amp;#8220;trapped on an island&amp;#8221; plotline, there&amp;#8217;s almost a horror movie feel in the background. I appreciated that the ghosts were scary, because the last paranormal romance with ghosts I read, the ghost was the heroine, and it just doesn&amp;#8217;t seem right. Creepy ghosts are much more like it.My one complaint was the real-life bad guy. I think the book could have done without that addition, since there was already enough tension with the ghost story and trying to figure that out. Plus, the story was unique, and the addition of the stalker ex-boyfriend made it feel, at times, a little formulaic. I could easily see this novel without the ghosts being a standalone contemporary romance novel, so anything that made it feel more that way was a downside, in my opinion.All in all, BETTER HOMES &amp; HAUNTINGS was classic Molly Harper, with laughs and romance and just enough paranormal to round it out. While it isn&amp;#8217;t my favorite Harper, it definitely stands on its own merit, and since it isn&amp;#8217;t a series, there really isn&amp;#8217;t much investment required (though I wouldn&amp;#8217;t mind a book about some of the other characters&amp;#8230;).I would recommend it to anybody looking for a fun, creative romance read.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Standard romance tropes make this not the best Harper, but fun nonetheless&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1404691200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;07 7, 2014&quot;}</td>

I did keep wondering okay who did this. Why did they do this. That is the mystery of it all. The book starts off really strong, you have a bear attack and once the bear is hunted down there is something mysterious in its belly. After that the story takes you onto a murder that has happened in the nearest town. Prosecutor Rebecka Martinsson has her work made out for her. She has a murder to solve and somehow the past all comes together. The answer to the present is in the past.Now at times I got confused because the author would use the last names of the officers and prosecutor. I don&#39;t like being confused in a story hence the 4 star rating.Rebecka has to deal with a young and upcoming prosecutor who wants to push her off the case. But Rebecka takes it all into her own hands but what price does she pay?With this murder happening, Rebecka takes a look back at the family&#39;s past and notices more &amp;#34;accidents&amp;#34; have happened.Along with this book taking place in the present we are also taken back into the 1900&#39;s where all this pretty much started. I liked the going back and forth between the past and present but at times I felt it was abrupt. As I would get into reading what the dogs found and Marcus the little boy who acts like a wild dog and then bam! In your face you in the past with the school teacher Elina Pettersson. Which when you read her past you get a bit sad. I know there was one part with Elina that I read and I felt so bad for what happened to her.If you like mysteries then I would give this book a read. I think I will be reading more from this author in the future.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Pretty interesting read.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1402963200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 17, 2014&quot;}</td>

This is one of my books of the year.An incredibly well written book that draws you in to Jonah&#39;s story of being a Master.  He is dominant, confident and articulate without being arrogant.  He is thoughtful but speaks his mind and has an understanding of women that just screams wow off the page at you.In telling his story in this way, we get to see his very thoughtful insights into how he views his role as a Master.  He is a Master that thrives on deriving pleasure from the women who submit to him.Leticia&#39;s character grows in confidence as his story unfolds and she becomes bolder with him in a subtle way.  The way that their relationship grows and develops is not in your face but done with subtle nuances.And wow!! The ending was not what I expected - it was so much better than the very predictable endings that we see in pretty much every other book in this genre.  I like the unpredictability of it and together two very well developed and likeable characters in Jonah and Leticia.  Amazing read!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Wow, just wow!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1398643200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 28, 2014&quot;}</td>

Jon Foyt is a talented author.  He has a way with words that are both literary and a joy to read.  Foyt builds on the character development as the story progress.  You cannot help but fall in love with Christopher and his cat Marcel Proust.  And forgive the final outcome at the end.  The plot is interesting with a parallel story occurring throughout the book.  There are twists and turns that keep you guessing to the dramatic ending at the last page.  Highly recommended and certainly look forward to more of Foyt&#39;s work.[...]<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>overall<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-c1">5.0</span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>summary<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>Superb, literary, enjoyable, and exciting<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>unixReviewTime<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-c1">1398211200</span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>reviewTime<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>04 23, 2014<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>}</td>

Available in English translation for the first time (indeed, the last of Nesb&amp;#8217;s novels to be translated into English), this is Det. Harry Hole&amp;#8217;s second dark adventure, one that sends him away from Norway yet again, this time to the seedy underworlds of Bangkok, Thailand in pursuit of the killer of the Norwegian ambassador there.Readers of &amp;#8220;The Bat&amp;#8221; will recall that Nesb is a master of evoking atmosphere and place. But unlike that superior first novel in the Harry Hole series, &amp;#8220;The Cockroaches&amp;#8221; never seems to rise to the occasion. Sure, it&amp;#8217;s entertaining, but the Thai setting he evokes is so squalid, and the characters so dejected, that you might want to consciously do something intermittently cheerful as you read.Despite its shortcomings, this is a must-read for all Nesb fans.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Some very unseemly scenarios, but a must for Nesb fans&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1392163200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 12, 2014&quot;}</td>

Arc was provided by net galleyLet me start by dying that I really need the second book like now!!!! This book had it all, the drama, the romance, the using your brain, it was just amazing! I spent the whole boom on the edge of my seat not wanting it to end, but sadly all great things must end.We have Sophia, she was stubborn and nosey, wanted answers when she wanted them, her heart was literarily beating for Michael, he pushed her away because she thought she wa a test, but little does he know she&#39;s not. Dante wAs sad, my heart broke for him when he searched and searched for his love and finds her and she loves another, the three POVs didn&#39;t bother me at all I love more then one POV in romance books. Sophia&#39;s dad had me freaking out the whole book because I didn&#39;t understand what was happening, it threw me for a loop when the answers came out! I was dumbfounded and had to stop reading and think, Sophia&#39;s love for her dad went beyond anything on what she went tru to try to save him. At the end I was confused but hope the next book is quick!!!This is a paranormal romance at it&#39;s finest!!!!! The angels and demons made this book! The plot was amazing and the H/h were lovable. I&#39;m not the best at reviews but it rocked my socks off and I&#39;m glad I got a chance to read this!!!!!!!! 5 amazing stars!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;I want more!!!!!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1397779200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 18, 2014&quot;}</td>

Her word pictures transport me right to where she wants me to be, like a fly on the wall, privy to everyone&#39;s thoughts &amp; feelings.  This storyline, and her familiar cast of characters runs through at least two of her series. That&#39;s reassuring because I&#39;m always left with wanting to know more.  Now I just get the next book &amp; I&#39;m part of the neighborhood again!I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys romance, including teenagers. You can be sure this book is full of, dare I say it?, old fashioned family values liberally sprinkled with God&#39;s involvement in our daily lives.  It is strictly PG, a joy all the way through to the end.

I found this series on the Herding Cats and Burning Soup blog. It appealed to me and as the first book was free I downloaded it. I&#39;m not into the Lifestyle so I cannot comment on how realistic it is but it is well written and puts books like Fifty Shades of Grey in the shade so to speak!I like the way the author introduces the completely innocent heroine to this \&quot;forbidden world\&quot;. She has a car wreck, its pouring rain and goes for help to the nearest place she can find. An imposing mansion which turns out to be a BDSM club. The characters are very believable. I could really feel for the heroine Jessica experiencing this life for the first time. Of course she had a choice to walk away but she endures. There is tension, passion and a whole lot of raunchy sex.Master Z, a Dom and owner of the club is very intimidating but sexy as hell. The sex scenes are graphic so may not appeal to everyone! I loved it and have since bought the rest of the series! I congratulate the author on writing about a subject in such detail that is usually considered taboo!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;New to Erotica, Smokin&#39; Hot!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1404864000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;07 9, 2014&quot;}</td>

Part journal, part memoir, and part story, Micha Boyett pens an alluring yet delicate rendering of coming to terms with her own importance as a person, though her course in life may have changed. Very knowledgeable of the Benedictine prayer life, the author causes us to stop and ponder our own true worth, as well as the sincerity and purity behind prayer. Appropriate for any age, either gender, this book would be a most-welcomed gift by a new mom. I look forward to searching out her blog having read her book.RATING:4 (out of 5) pennies*I received a complimentary copy of Found: A Story of Questions, Grace and Everyday Prayer from Worthy Publishing for my honest review*&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Beautifully written...&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1396396800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 2, 2014&quot;}</td>

I read it all even though I was not impressed because sometimes first impressions are not indicative of the contents later. War is horrible no matter what century or what country. This books title and excerpt lead the reader to believe it was about a horse and young man and their relationship while searching for the boys father. In actuality it was only about a young man&#39;s observations of other people and their cruelty. No where in this book did he find anyone kind and this is not how human nature is. While many men and women are reduced to the lowest levels of human behavior most are not and somehow rise above the horrors of war. I was very disappointed in how the story unfolded. The ending was typical of a cynical look at human nature.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 2.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Not what I expected&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1395014400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 17, 2014&quot;}</td>

The book begins with Meg Elginbrodde and Geoffrey Levett in a taxi.  Levett is a wealthy businessman, used to getting what he wants and he is desperately in love with Meg and intends to marry her.  The problem is that since their engagement was announced, Meg has been receiving photographs from her husband - who she believed had died in the war.  She has turned to Campion and Detective Chief Inspector Charles Luke for advice, when a meeting is proposed between her and her former husband. The man she glimpses across the fog bound platform of a station is certainly not her husband, but the mystery deepens after he is questioned and released.What follows is an extremely atmospheric mystery;  set in a post-war, weary London in a middle of a pea souper fog.  As events escalate, Levett goes missing and witnesses are killed.  A convict called Jack Havoc has escaped from prison &amp;#8211; he is hunting a &amp;#8220;treasure&amp;#8221;, while Luke and Campion search for him in the &amp;#8220;Smoke,&amp;#8221; which is the fog bound city of London.  There are some wonderful characters, such as the saintly Canon Avril, the brilliantly named Tiddy Doll and the elusive Havoc himself &amp;#8211; the Tiger of the story.I had only read one Campion novel before and I found myself a little lost so far into the series, as obviously you were meant to know some familiar characters.  However, Campion himself did not feature strongly in the book, meaning that it worked quite well as a stand-alone story.  London itself &amp;#8211; battered, weary, down at heel &amp;#8211; is almost a character in itself.  Everyone stumbles around, unable to see and events are revealed slowly, almost as glimpses through the fog.  If you are interested in London shortly after the war, then this novel gives you a great view of the City at that time and is worth reading just for the historical aspect of the book.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;The Tiger in the Smoke&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1399766400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 11, 2014&quot;}</td>

I just thought that whole scene with her screaming at the zombies and then being able to walk away unmolested was more pivotal than it apparently was.

My love for Alexander and Olivia began with Beautiful Mess and has continued to grow. My bloodshot eyes from lack of sleep is more confirmation of that love (and the 2 re-reads since the initial). Can not wait for this story to continue. I both anticipate and dread the moment Olivia discovers her past and the secrets that have been kept from her and fear the heart break I will experience with Alexander if she chooses to run to deal with the emotions. I hope that the growth Olivia experienced emotionally in Tragic Wreck help her to deal with the pain of the truth. Another bonus to a great book, is the friends in the book. I believe our friends are an extension of us as people who help us grow and loved the relationship not only Olivia had with Mo/Kiera, but the bond that Alexander formed with them too.Side note: love an author that includes playlist and incorporates music into books. It adds another life to the story.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Obsession Continues&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1393718400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 2, 2014&quot;}</td>

The Heroine, Charli, is likeable, feisty and challenging.  Thed Hero, Grant.....well....what can I say......a great Dom.  I could not wait to read Grant&#39;s story.  His appearances in the other two books had me wanting to read about THE man....the owner of the club.  Owners of a BDSM club is always my favorite Doms.  Once again, this book actually had an interesting storyline that went with the book well and not page after page of BDSM sex.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I like erotic books but some books like Fifty Shades was way over the top in sex scenes which became page turners.  It is a very romantic book and when you finally hear all of Grant&#39;s story, you are pulled into his sadness because his love, his wife, his mate, was so great.  You also felt sorry for Charli because she loved him so much but would not settle for nothing less than a true relationship.  Now....what I did not like in this book is that the BDSM scenes seemed a little bit more darker than what I am use to.  Usually, it is someone else in the club who is receiving the beatings and the two main characters observe.  Not this book and she gets beaten hard.....not spanked with the hand (but that happens too by someone else because Grant is sharing????)  I do not care for where the Sub gets beaten so hard that she cannot lie on her back because it is so sore.  I guess I am old school and I am not into being shared.  If I am a Sub, I sub for only one person and that would go on the List.  Of course, in this book, that is somehow forgotten.  I also do not care for two guys on one girl at the same time and it seems to happen in the &amp;#34;A Loving on the Edge Novels.&amp;#34;  I am just not into that and I cannot see a person who is new at this sort of life would like it either.  My feathers get sort of ruffled when the beatings over something so minor occurs.  This feminist does not care for that, and I cringe when the scene is played out.  Of course, the writer happens to write that the Sub is a feminist but somehow she puts her feelings aside when being dealt with when she has done something wrong, which to me, is such a small thing.  I have no problems with bondage, the scenes, the displaying of the Sub in a scene for all to see, but it is really hard to get past the beatings.  That is something too dark for me.  I prefer Doms who are not into that sort of thing as well.  But all in all, I did give this book five stars because I love how Mrs. Loren writes, and I did not want to give it four stars simply because I shy away from beatings and it seems that others like it.  She makes her Doms very appealing and one cannot help but like her Subs.  As I stated earlier, I love owners of BDSM clubs.  They are the most interesting and the erotic scenes are fantastic.  Do I recommend this book, you bet.  Just be prepared for the more darker side of BDSM.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;There is not much to not like in this book&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1401408000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 30, 2014&quot;}</td>

Not only do you fall in love with the characters, she has a way of making you feel like you need to be a better person. In a society quick to judge based on the info fed to us by the internet, tv, and radio this book reminds us that not everything is real. We hear what they want us to hear.

But when Ashling and her mother get there they learn that he intends to marry her off, even though she is only 14.  Ashling and her mother protest, but it is Ashling&#39;s brother who persuades their father to let Ashling wait a few more years before she is to be married to her intended.  A few years pass and Ashling and her mother are found by their pack&#39;s enemy.  They run back to her father for protection and it&#39;s decided that Ashling should go into hiding with Baran, a sort of lone wolf.  While living with him she meets Grey.  He&#39;s not a werewolf but there is something about him that she can&#39;t put her finger on, plus she is very interested in him.  Grey reciprocates the attraction, but many obstacles stand in the way of their happy ever after.This story started out great and kept me interested.  It&#39;s definitely unique compared to other werewolf stories I&#39;ve read.  I was a little turned off that Ashling was only 14 at first; I thought I was going to have to read about a 14 year old, but then in the next chapter, a few years pass, so that was good news for me.Ashling is a headstrong female.  She doesn&#39;t let anyone, including her father tie her down.  Basically, she does what she wants.  She had great character traits, but I still had a little trouble feeling connected to her.Let&#39;s talk about chemistry between Ashling and Grey.  I could tell the attraction was immediate; but for the rest of their relationship I just felt like something was missing.  I can&#39;t put my finger on it though.  I honestly didn&#39;t care if they were together or not.  I didn&#39;t feel the love as much as they were saying it to each other.The story kept me very interested in the beginning, then I did get a little bored towards the middle, but the ending picked up again and I really couldn&#39;t put it down.  All in all, Bloodmark was a good book.  And the bonus is that it&#39;s the first book of a series.  The ending got a lot more interesting to me, and I think the second book is going to be even better.My Rating:  3 1/2 out of 5 stars~Pam*****I received this book free from the author, in exchange for an honest review.*****&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;It&#39;s definitely unique compared to other werewolf stories I&#39;ve read.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1389744000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 15, 2014&quot;}</td>

I agree with another reviewer that the names are a little crazy and I did struggle with those at first, but then again Chewbacca was a strange name too and we now all know that.

They probably got together and said something like: &amp;#34;Hey, let&#39;s write a business novel about Theory of Constraints applied to IT Ops&amp;#34; - that sums up what they were trying to achieve.If you have some knowledge about IT Ops, business novels and TCO, this books sounds as straightforward and predictable as a rail. So it&#39;s not the greatest fiction (the plot is fairy tale simple, the characters are over simplified), not the greatest IT Ops case study (while the technical language is perfectly real, the idea of, let&#39;s say, offloading &amp;#34;brute force&amp;#34; processing to an external cloud provider or reducing the release cycle within days or fighting off the auditors - all those examples look turning the company around seem hard to believe) and not the greatest book on TCO (for example the book doesn&#39;t tell about TCO limitations and side effects stressing out only the positives).However, having said all of that, the book creates an instantly recognized mix of a typical IT Ops management problems and it touches the nerve of hundreds of thousands people in IT Ops or working closely with IT Ops, so it gotta become a big hit.  It gives a very accurate snapshot of what problems IT Ops are facing now and what the mainstream approaches to solve those problems are at them moment. So definitely worth reading if you want to get familiar with the current state of IT Ops.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;An attempt to present a study book on it ops management in a fiction format - worth reading&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1391299200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 2, 2014&quot;}</td>

Hagan, Jr. I&amp;#8217;m a fan of the 1997 movie about the ill-fated ship and I&amp;#8217;ve seen the movie many times. Because of that, I was immediately drawn to the book&amp;#8217;s title. After I finished reading Hagan&amp;#8217;s book, I can easily say that the author delivers on his promise to motivate, challenge, and empower his readers. He made an excellent choice for a topic. The book&amp;#8217;s cover art alone is intriguing. Even though I&amp;#8217;ve read some other books about the Titanic, I learned some new information here that I didn&amp;#8217;t know. The author has obviously done his homework.I LOVED the poem from Dr. Benjamin Mayes that is on the back cover. I&amp;#8217;d never read that before. There&amp;#8217;s an important lesson in those rhymes that all of us can benefit from. I think it was very appropriate to feature it in this book.The author poses many thought-provoking questions. For instance, if you were among the over fifteen-hundred passengers on that ocean liner and you knew the end of your life was at hand, would you have lived your life differently?  Whoa, reality check! Our lives can be over in the blink of an eye. We get so tied up and self-absorbed at times that we can miss some of the warning signs of danger ahead. Sometimes it takes a Titanic-sized event in our own lives for us to pay attention to what&amp;#8217;s really going on around us.  Perfect peace can only be found through God alone and His gift is there for all of us.  That some choose to reject or ignore the gift is one of the consequences of sin in a fallen world.The writing is good and the book is easy to read. I liked the format a lot &amp;#8211; references at the bottom, fascinating trivia, historical facts, effective use of bold type, historical drawings and photos.  Most importantly, the scriptures the author chose to accompany his work are right on point in my opinion. The lesson titles are aptly named and I appreciated his modern-day parallels. There were a few minor grammar issues, but I didn&amp;#8217;t see anything huge. There was also one confusing sentence for me with some awkward wording. Other than that, I was engaged and eager to read the whole book.There are so many takeaways. One of my favorite lines: &amp;#8220;That we need to be grateful for every moment that we spend on earth.&amp;#8221; Amen to that! I think this book would appeal to a vast audience, Christians and also Non-Christians looking for perspective on the trials of life.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Well Done&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1401667200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 2, 2014&quot;}</td>

For example, affection can be contaminated by self-centeredness, friendship by exclusivity, romantic love by idolatry. The solution, as expected, is agape - the unconditional love, but only in the context of a deep understanding of the love of God, and our ultimate dependence on Him. Lewis&#39; comment on bereavement towards the very end of the book indeed sounds a bit harsh, but it by no means detracts from the overall soundness of the book.

Augustine&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [0, 0], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;All God&#39;s Children was a bit of a different take on WWII historical fiction. Instead of the usual ultra-brave heroine and hero fighting against the evil Nazis in any way they can; we have Beth, a Quaker pacifist, and Josef, a doctor in the German army who happens to believe in the Germany he remembers from childhood.After reading several WWII fiction books that mostly center in the U.S., England, or France, it was nice to read a slightly different view of things in Germany and of the many German&#39;s that fought against Hitler&#39;s regime in a myriad of ways.One of the fascinating things about the book is all of the Quaker beliefs and methods that are key to the story and how certain characters act. I knew almost nothing about the Society Of Friends, they are a little-written-about group, and so the fact that this story centers around a Quaker girl and some of her family and friends made this story even more interesting for me.The author does an excellent job of immersing the reader in WWII era Munich. I could see everything so clearly in my mind&#39;s eye. I felt like I was walking the streets of the city with Beth and Josef, stepping inside the apartment with Uncle Franz and Aunt Ilse, hiding in the basement from falling bombs with Liesl.The last third of the book did seem a bit hurried to me, causing the historical detail and character emotions to take a little dip.That aside, All God&#39;s Children was very enjoyable and I will definitely be looking forward to the release of the next book in this series, Simple Faith.The combination of setting the story in a  little used WWII location, the Quaker pacifism, (old) German patriotism, detail in locations, interesting characters, and just the history, make this a great book for lovers of Historical fiction.(I received a copy of this book from the publisher through The Book Club Network in exchange for my honest review. All opinions are my own)&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Experience Munich and its dangers in World War 2!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1388966400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 6, 2014&quot;}</td>

She wants to add another dimension to that image, and makes some odd choices in what she writes about, the most talked-about being her obsession with sex, and that mars the book.

No hesitation. I love that True was more than it seems from the description, that it wasn&#39;t simply the story of the bad boy and the virgin. It wasn&#39;t a sexual awakening or frivolous at all. True is a love story, pure and simple, of a two people who are near opposites, but fit together so very perfectly.Tyler and Rory were not one-dimensional characters, defined by the sexuality or social standing. They both held many layers, and that complexity really bonded me to both. Tyler grew up in such turmoil, and works so hard to keep his brothers together. He wants more out of life, but doesn&#39;t know that he&#39;ll ever get it. Tyler has a tough exterior, but is vulnerable with Rory. He&#39;s cocky, yet not really conceited. He was brave, yet scared to give his heart to a woman whom he deems too good for him. I loved that he loved Rory exactly as she was.Though I couldn&#39;t find any of myself in Rory, I connected with her deeply. I would say that is testament to McCarthy&#39;s ability to bring these characters off the page, make me love them. Rory was...she was just Rory. Logical to a fault, quiet and unassuming, always withholding herself and her emotions. I loved who Rory became with Tyler. That she wasn&#39;t afraid to push him, question him, and love him. Once Rory decided to open up to Tyler, it was like she became a better version of herself. She was still way literal, but she also joked more. Hugged more, allowed people to truly know her.Oh gosh, I sound like a sap. And I am one when it comes to books such as this. I think what I love about this series is that it is just so real. The characters don&#39;t come packaged with the right words or decisions, they mess up and they grovel and they learn and grow. That sort of experience is what I love so much about reading.There was a moment in True that struck me hard, and I haven&#39;t stopped thinking about it since. It&#39;s when Tyler and Rory are discussing Streetcar Named Desire, and Rory just can&#39;t understand why these characters are behaving so illogically...&amp;#34;If they would just communicate with each other, they could resolve all their issues in ten minutes.&amp;#34;&amp;#34;That&#39;s what makes the book so realistic,&amp;#34; he told me dryly. &amp;#34;Real people don&#39;t discuss this shit with each other.&amp;#34;He had a point. I didn&#39;t really discuss my emotions with anyone either. I had spent most of my life being a silent observer. &amp;#34;Oh.&amp;#34;In one fell swoop, I got it. Literature wasn&#39;t intended to be about perfect people, it was about flaws, very real and very deep human flaws.That is an excellent reminder, I think.If you&#39;re looking for a deep, intense, sexy and fun New Adult series, True Believers is, without a doubt, one of my favorites.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;I&#39;m a Believer&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1404086400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 30, 2014&quot;}</td>

It is the story of Elizabeth Enderby and Sir Hilary St. John. Elizabeth had escaped from her husband who mistreated her and had fled to London to her sister home. The story tells about how Elizabeth and Hilary met, their lives. Also about how Mr. Enderby finds her and how he ends up  murdered. This story gives insight as to how men could and did mistreat their wives. Also about the criminal justice system worked then.

While she knows there has been destruction of personal items or the items have been stolen, Charlotte has promised her father she will again try to raise the rice crop and live on the land.The paragraph above states the setting of the fictional tale that is actually based on a real historical figure named Elizabeth Waties Allston Pringle.  Can you imagine what this woman witnessed in her lifetime?  How about thinking of what her life was like before and after the Civil War?  Charlotte is based loosely on the real life experiences of Elizabeth, and the author, with some minor adaptations, places her novel near where the real plantation where Elizabeth lived.  After you read the fictional tale, the author shares how she came to learn about this unique woman and her life.There are characters that portray what southern people must have felt during Reconstruction along with what many veterans suffered during a horrific war.  They had to learn to live in a new society that was still forming.  With so few eligible men to marry, we see a jealous female antagonist see that she indeed ends up with the one man she sets her eyes on no matter who gets hurt in reaching her goal.  Yellow fever is an epidemic that costs many lives in New Orleans in 1868.  With the destruction so complete, few can prove they own the land on which they return to.Dorothy Love writes a moving masterpiece that keeps the reader reading until they see how the unknown ending is revealed.  I simply cannot express how much the real woman Elizabeth, along with others who lived in the south before, during and after the war, had to learn how to start all over.  Readers see how a woman who has her faith shredded by heartbreak learns to trust God again in a time when each day brings new trials, triumphs or tragedy.  What a tenacity people displayed to endure and then to thrive each day.  Perhaps like our female lead character they did so by looking to God and putting one foot in front of the other time and time again.  A historical novel rich with history, faith, perseverance and romance!  Don&amp;#8217;t pass up reading this book!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Carolina Gold&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1389312000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 10, 2014&quot;}</td>

My heart breaks for these young girls who have their childhoods stripped away.

Also, the people are not the kind I would like as friends, because it is their character I object to. I would pay for half the reading, for half the cost - on sale.

When Frances died, she promised to communicate, telepathically, from the other side of the &amp;#34;veil.&amp;#34; In Helen&#39;s book, she describes a message from Frances that death is not to be feared, for it is not the end. &amp;#34;Death of the body is but a gentle passing to a much freer life.&amp;#34; Our soul is then gently, &amp;#34;cleansed, healed and released,&amp;#34; as we continue through various stages of transition toward &amp;#34;The Light.&amp;#34;  She explains that our earthly bodies and personality continue to transform thru many levels or planes of light, which she describes as having different vibrational frequencies, until we are eventually one with &amp;#34;The Light.&amp;#34; She then goes on to use this reasoning for such statements as Christ&#39;s words, &#39;I am the Light of the World,&amp;#34; for he projects pure light and as people transform, they &amp;#34;Let their light shine.&amp;#34;These words are very comforting for people who continue to ask if there is an afterlife. However, her description of the afterlife broken up into various groups who are set to perform various jobs, etc are a bit difficult to conceptualize.  Certainly, this view of the afterlife differs from what we are taught and led to believe in various churches or religions. Testimony of Light is an interesting concept of the afterlife and touches on the possibility of reincarnation and the reasons why some may have that experience.The book and the message it puts forth will certainly test your faith and ideas of the afterlife. Some parts of her theory are difficult to understand. The book should be read slowly and perhaps a second time before forming an opinion.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Death is not to be feared&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1398816000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 30, 2014&quot;}</td>

It was kind of cool seeing the world a couple of years after the virus happened but I found that I didn&#39;t feel attached to any of the characters like I did with most of the characters in the other trilogy.  Perhaps the next one will give me that connection as I believe this one was meant to just give us a feel for the world.

His answer is that we often misinterpret underdogs, and that because of their experience and circumstances underdogs tend to be tenacious, play by their own rules, and are cunning.  Then there&#39;s the problem of authority, which in its often expression and extension of its strength over-estimates the enemy and degrades its own authority.For loyal readers of Malcolm Gladwell, and I certainly count myself as one of them, &amp;#34;David and Goliath&amp;#34; is a sure letdown from Gladwell at his peak (&amp;#34;Outliers&amp;#34;).  The beauty and facility of his prose are still there, but his thinking -- never his strength -- has become muddied and muddled.  He has a habit of making points that are entirely obvious, and sometimes even making points that have no basis in reality.  For example, in one chapter on academic achievement, Gladwell assumes that every student at Harvard wants to study STEM, and if they switch from STEM to arts it&#39;s become they couldn&#39;t hack it.  And what is his advice to make sure that America produces enough STEM talent?  Encourage top-performing high school students to apply to less prestigious institutions, where they will become a big fish in a small pond and not become lost and insecure as a small fish in a big pond.That argument is intuitive, but Gladwell has a bad habit of trying to wrap his intuitive arguments under the cloak of scientific rigor, and so what often happens is that when you pull the cloak away there&#39;s really nothing there at all.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;The Advantages of Disadvantages, and the Disadvantages of Advantages&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1390348800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 22, 2014&quot;}</td>

It&#39;s in a genre I don&#39;t normally choose, but good writing will suck me in every time and I thought Dana Reinhardt did a fabulous job giving life and voice to the Golden sisters.We didn&#39;t need anybody else.  But more than that,we were better  without anybody else.The story is about Nell and Layla, their family and friends. They are sisters who are very, very close. Layla&#39;s the older sister. She&#39;s one of those girls whose life seems charmed. She&#39;s smart, talented, loving and athletic. A sensible teen who has her act together. Nell is her little sister. Nell appears to be every bit as gifted and smart as her sister, but she&#39;s at an age and a place in her life where she can&#39;t see that yet. And for the time being she&#39;s in Layla&#39;s shadow. But she&#39;s okay with that. She loves Layla fiercely.I&#39;ll probably always remember where I was andwhat I wore and all that, it was that kind of moment.I could no longer pretend.Something was happening.Something that shouldn&#39;t be.And I had absolutely no idea what to do.WE ARE THE GOLDENS is about love and betrayal and the basic human condition. Our inability, on the one hand, to see our own doom racing towards us. And our total freaking cluelessness as to what to do when we see disaster poised to strike someone we love.~This book worked for me on so many levels. The writing was excellent. Nell&#39;s voice was a perfect blend of intelligence and innocence. It made her dilemmas believable. I also loved Nell&#39;s relationship with Felix, her BFF. Adorable isn&#39;t strong enough a word.What I don&#39;t understand was Dana Reinhardt&#39;s having Nell converse with the dead boys. They were probably there to underscore some subtle point, but I wasn&#39;t smart enough to figure it out.I don&#39;t have a lot of books in my repertoire to compare this to.  But if you enjoyed  Swati Avasthi&#39;s SPLIT, or  Francisco Stork&#39;s LAST SUMMER OF THE DEATH WARRIORS, or even Green&#39;s FAULT IN OUR STARS, you might want to pick this up.I think the &#39;undetermined&#39; ending is going to throw some readers. (Lady or the Tiger?)  But I also think it&#39;s part and parcel of what is going to make WE ARE THE GOLDENS a fabulous book club read. There is just going to be so much to discuss.4.5 Stars for me&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Couldn&#39;t Put It Down&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1401667200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 2, 2014&quot;}</td>

To me, it&#39;s shocking that almost no mainstream doctors and so few \&quot;experts\&quot;, much less writers of books like this, are aware that fibromyalgia is a symptom of low thyroid (hypothyroid). Shocking.There are no lab tests for many causes of low thyroid, so at least 80% of us are mis-diagnosed, because your doctor will only treat lab tests, not you. The FREE basal (at rest) temperature self-test is THE gold standard for low thyroid problems and - with your symptoms - means more than any lab test (although most conventional doctors, including endos, won&#39;t agree but then they&#39;re not trained to understand thyroid problems - go to the Broda Barnes foundation website and click on the \&quot;Educational Info\&quot; button on the left for how to get a list of thyroid-sympathetic doctors in your state.(I&#39;d always suspected a thyroid problem but it was not until, after 20 years of being told all my lab tests were \&quot;normal\&quot;, that a Broda Barnes trained doctor finally put me on the road to recovery. A year after I insisted my cousin also see this doctor, she said I&#39;d saved her life.)The basal temperature home self-test will pick up conditions that current lab tests don&#39;t, such as thyroid resistance. Most digital thermometers are not accurate so find a good basal digital thermometer, the kind used by women to identify their fertile days.The stopthethyroidmadness website has excellent instructions for this self-test, as well as several for adrenal fatigue, which often goes hand-in-hand with low thyroid. The two most common health problems worldwide, they&#39;re rarely diagnosed or treated.I also suggest:- \&quot;The Metabolic Treatment of Fibromyalgia\&quot; by Lowe, a very expensive medical book of more than 1,000 pages, essentially explaining how fibromyalgia is successfully treated with thyroid supplements;- `Hypothyroidism Type 2&#39; by Mark Starr (\&quot;type 2\&quot; meaning the thyroid problems for which there are no lab tests and therefore they don&#39;t get diagnosed) explains how all chronic pain is linked to low thyroid, including those involved with fibromyalgia, diabetes, heart problems, both bleeding &amp; blood clots (including strokes) and some cancers. If you have any kind of chronic pain, you need to know that some are calling low thyroid the silent epidemic (silent because officially denied);- \&quot;Hypothyroidism, Health &amp; Happiness: The Riddle of Illness Revealed\&quot; by Steven F. Hotze a good introduction;- As there is rarely more than a brief mention of the benefits of iodine in thyroid books, I also suggest \&quot;Iodine, Why You Need It and Why You Can&#39;t Live Without It\&quot; by David Brownstein MD. The latest edition is available as an ebook from drbrownstein[dot]directfrompublisher[dot]comAlso, those with fibromyalgia experience a significant reduction in their symptoms when taking a melatonin supplement and melatonin can reduce some symptoms of IBS, such as abdominal pain. Melatonin increases the conversion of precursor thyroid hormone T4 to the active T3 form. It can reactivate the important but much-ignored thymus gland, which degenerates almost completely over the years. It also improves zinc absorption, which in turn boosts several immune functions. Melatonin therapy also helps spleen recovery, another immune-system component which declines with age. Its ability to improve sleep and dreaming is a tremendous boon to memory. It is one of the most powerful antioxidants made by the body.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 2.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;nothing works long-term, until you address the real cause&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1403049600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 18, 2014&quot;}</td>

Lawyers and judges need to be emotionally unattached to their cases, and this book definitely reads like it was written by a lawyer. I find myself asking &amp;#34;how did she feel?&amp;#34; during many of the pages. She talks nothing about her feelings for her boyfriend/husband. Was he her first love? He would visit her every weekend during college -- how did she feel about the long-distance relationship? Did she have any doubts? As for her accomplishments, I still find myself wondering how she felt about herself. I&#39;m sure this book is inspiring to many people, but I was hoping to learn more about the woman behind the robe, not the making of a judge.

First off, just so you are aware Fall (Cold Mark #1) is a serial novel.  In my excitement to read another book by my new favorite author, I didn&#39;t see how short this novella is...  However, don&#39;t let that stop you from diving into this amazing new series.This is a (very) adult sci-fi romance that is exceptionally original.  The main character Braita is brave young woman thrust into a terrifying new world.  Everything she&#39;s ever known is now different.  This first novella gets you through the beginnings of how she ends up on the foreign world of Mian, and how she begins living with Malik and Leo.  You&#39;ll be amazed at the journey you go through in just 8 short chapters, and I guarantee you&#39;ll be left wanting more.  I absolutely can&#39;t wait for the next novella in this series.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;More praise for Scarlett Dawn!!!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1405641600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;07 18, 2014&quot;}</td>

Then, someone tries to poison you. You&#39;re framed for a fire that injures your friend, and further attempts are made on your life. The killer? It&#39;s you! Copied, by S.M. Anderson, from Curiosity Quills Press is a first-rate thriller with science fiction overtones that explores several ethical questions including the issue of genetic engineering, human cloning, and the prospect that a corporation can \&quot;own\&quot; a clone because they own the DNA of that person.More importantly, Copied also examines the theory of nature vs. nurture regarding two identical clones. The protagonists of the story -- very likable ones -- Alexander Mitchell (\&quot;Xan\&quot;) and his friend Lacey (a remarkably bright, teen girl) are determined to figure out just who and why someone would want Xan dead.I don&#39;t give spoilers, and there are plenty of clever plot twists and action that keep the story moving at a fast pace. Incidentally, while there is certainly room for a sequel, the story is self-contained and a very good read for all ages. I recommend it.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;(No spoiler review) Copied is a thought provoking sci-fi thriller for all ages&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1390262400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 21, 2014&quot;}</td>

Since he can&amp;#8217;t bring himself to court again, he makes arrangements for a mail order bride.Sarah Livingston&amp;#8217;s father just doesn&amp;#8217;t understand how much she wants a husband and children of her own, and he doesn&amp;#8217;t think anyone is good enough, unless it&amp;#8217;s a man who doesn&amp;#8217;t want to marry her. When her father decides to send her to Uncle Brice&amp;#8217;s in Georgia after her last escapade, she knows she&amp;#8217;ll have to do something desperate. She decides to run to her friend in New York, but, on the way, she meets a young woman crying because she has to become a mail order bride. Sarah switches places with her, and when she meets Walker, she knows she did the right thing. Can she put off telling him the truth long enough to make him fall in love with her? As she tries, things become more and more complicated and messy.For the most part, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Sarah is stubborn but lovable, because she has a big heart and wants to do the right thing, even when she makes bad choices. Walker is just as stubborn in his own way, and I could understand why he was leery of being deceived. Some of the things that happened with Caleb wasn&amp;#8217;t rational, and I was surprised Sarah ran away when she had promised Walker she wouldn&amp;#8217;t. The cover of the book is also wrong, because Sarah was a redhead. Overall, however, the story was riveting and a page-turner, and I had no problems giving it five stars.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;I Found It a Page-turner&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1393891200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 4, 2014&quot;}</td>

It just came out of the blue.  It&#39;s like those potato chips that once you start eating them you can&#39;t stop.  The first thing I did was to go look for more of Julia Heaberlin&#39;s books.  I was all, \&quot;How did I not know about you?\&quot;  This is a brilliant storyteller who is just getting warmed up.  This is only her second novel?  She writes a story as complex with intrigue and mystery as any of the greats.  The last time I remember finding a writer who was so compelling was Jodi Picoult (and I am still not reading her because of what she did at the end of My Sister&#39;s Keeper).This story is mystery over mystery with many fabulous layers.  The characters are rich and brilliantly drawn.  There was depth to the characters that just kept getting better.Knowing the storyline is only a part of it, but nowhere near the entire story.  This is a book that caused me to reread the ending and then the beginning.  Then the ending.  And I skimmed a few chapters.  It was all there.-Gertrude&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Stunning&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1397088000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 10, 2014&quot;}</td>

In general, they tend to be my least favourite of the supernatural creatures but with this twist I found myself enjoying them immensely.I really appreciated the way that you get to know the characters from the Salt Lake After Dark series better in this little sidebar. Although it isn`t strictly essential to the series as a whole, it definitely helps you get to know everyone in a much less serious manner.Overall, this was a catching tale that has me even more stoked to get back to the series proper.<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>overall<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-c1">4.0</span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>summary<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>a captivating interlude<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>unixReviewTime<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-c1">1398124800</span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>reviewTime<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>04 22, 2014<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>}</td>

Will is Hannah&amp;#8217;s brother&amp;#8217;s best friend from childhood. They haven&amp;#8217;t seen each other in years, but Hannah decides to catch up with Will again for old time sake. Hannah is no longer the young, little sister Will is use to seeing and when Hannah asks Will for sex advice, he can&amp;#8217;t deny her.I liked Will in Beautiful Stranger and he is even better in Beautiful Player. I also like how nerdy Hannah is. They become friends and bond over jogging in the mornings. It&amp;#8217;s really cute seeing Will train Hannah and help her with her love life. Hannah isn&amp;#8217;t a virgin, but she is differently not experienced. Chole and Sara from Beautiful Bastard and Beautiful Stranger, give Hannah a little make-over to get her up to par with the dating world.Hannah goes on a few dates and Will coaches her on how to act and what is appropriate and not appropriate behavior. Hannah has no filter and is really easy going with Will. I love this! She asks him random things, like if girls really do make the sounds she hears from watching porn. It&amp;#8217;s just too funny and too cute!Yes, Will is a crazy player, he has two hook-buddies, he meets weekly. Who does that?! BUT he&amp;#8217; also a really sweet guy and great friend. It&amp;#8217;s very rare to see a sweet friendship form out of thin air. Yes, Hannah and Will have a history, but I really enjoyed reading the little moments they share and seeing their fast friendship form.I really enjoyed reading Beautiful Player and it was nice to see the old gang too.

M. Moore \&quot;jen\&quot;&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [0, 1], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;I&#39;ve enjoyed Mallery&#39;s Fool&#39;s Gold Books - they&#39;re sweet and warm stories that bring a host of characters together in a charming series. I&#39;ve begun to notice a pattern, however, which doesn&#39;t always work. Towards the end of the story, the guy has some sort of crisis, breaks off the blossoming romance in a particularly hurtful way; she gets surrounded by her friends usually bearing margaritas; and then he comes back with his tail between his legs and humbly asks her back in a way that will be public or involve multiple other people. She immediately jumps into his arms and the book ends.  Its a formula that is started to make me roll my eyes, especially in this story due to the fact that Jack is extremely cruel to those around him there at the end. His redemption within the eyes of his friends and Larissa happens so fast, one starts to think the author ran up against a page length issue. In Fool&#39;s Gold, men get to be jerks - publically -  and women love them unconditionally. Redemption and forgiveness happens to two pages or less.And so these stories become fairy tales as opposed to a warm window into the heart of how complicated love and relationships are. I&#39;d love to see Mallery give as much time to the character development that happens when people have been pulled apart and hurt by love as she does to why they are so afraid of it in the first place.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Getting tired of the formulaic endings...&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1405036800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;07 11, 2014&quot;}</td>

I needed something light and easy with just enough angst but not too much and this book was the perfect fit.  Brody and the Twinkies stole my heart from the very beginning.  Kacie was wonderful.  She fought Brody and her feelings at first, but he was just too much and I was so happy to see her give in to her feelings.  The end was a cliffhanger but nothing too surprising and not too dramatic.

I have reviewed multiple books by this author and have liked every one.This book spans over 14 years. Lola is a young head strong math geek who believes that she is meant to change the world. She is giving it her best shot, but along the way she finds herself in a bit of trouble. And somehow she always manages to be wearing the wrong underwear every time it happens&amp;#8230;Wearing a red lace thong while getting arrested isn&#39;t really the best option. She meets and falls for a sexy Australian named Wayne but she doesn&#39;t feel like he&#39;s the boy she should love. But over the course of the 14 years they somehow keep winding up finding each other again, even while she fights it all the way. Lola doesn&#39;t really know what she wants for the future or how to get it, but along the way she finds that maybe the wrong guy could end up being the right one after all.The name alone should have you intrigued. It did me. It&#39;s a cute and funny title to go with a cute and funny book. It hooks you and you can&#39;t wait to see how it all ends up. It wasn&#39;t really what I expected. I don&#39;t think the description does this book justice. I was expecting a light hearted romantic comedy and got so much more. While the book is cute and funny it is also real and has some serious moments.Lola is a great character. She is witty and funny and she makes these hilarious random lists. She is real and flawed beyond belief but you can&#39;t help but laugh and cry and prey that she can get it together. And maybe even find her happy ending.There is a bunch of humorous surrounding characters that make you laugh and really feel for all Lola has to put up with. With a bossy, slightly self obsessed; over involved mom and a sister very similar to their mom it makes for a laugh fest. And that is just the beginning of her crazy family and friends.  Wayne is a total boy crush and I kept begging for him to finally get the girl. He is rugged and sexy and oo la la. I wish there had been more of him in the story though, he was that good.It jumps around a bit throughout the 14 years to explain everything, but it&#39;s worth it. I was hooked quickly and couldn&#39;t put it down. I recommend this book completely.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;I was expecting a light hearted romantic comedy and got so much more.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1393804800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 3, 2014&quot;}</td>

This theory being completely new and unheard of to me, I really liked how each assumption was clearly written out on a level that anyone could understand.  The book used a lot of comparisons to really get the point across and a little bit of history was brought in the mix so you could really see where it all started.  As with most theories and information on stocks and trading, the dow theory is heavily concentrated on recognizing, analyzing, and being aware of trends. The Dow Theory is definitely another weapon to use in your stock market strategy. I feel that if I become more familiar with it I can use it to my advantage allowing me to pay attention and use the facts over popular assumptions that are easy to follow.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Another Weapon To Add To My Trading Strategy&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1397606400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 16, 2014&quot;}</td>

She has a positive attitude knowing she&amp;#8217;ll find a solution to her problems especially since worry has never rolled up its sleeves and solved anything. And now, by a fortuitous happenstance she can continue making a difference and spreading cheer after being saved from an encounter with certain death by a stranger.Liam &amp;#8220;Kally&amp;#8221; Kallen has been scarred by his wife&amp;#8217;s death. Not only has his career suffered from it, he is also plagued with a guilt he can hardly talk about much less expunge, tinting his life a dull gray. That is until his concern leads him to save Noelle and his protectiveness guides him to incorporate her into his life. She gives him a new optimistic view and a second chance at love he thought he would never get again.The only problem is Liam and Noelle have too much to give. Liam in the way of material needs and Noelle in terms of positive emotions. Their relationship was too new, moving too fast it&amp;#8217;s overwhelming, forcing Noelle to walk away unless they can find a way to balance their bond.I ached for Liam and his broken soul. Liam made me sympathized with him and his tragic loss. I felt terrible for his misplaced guilt, I understood his confusion over the new opportunity life gave him at a perfect love. He&amp;#8217;s a different kind of take charge heroI enjoyed reading about.I was completely charmed with Noelle&amp;#8217;s character and her desire to do something meaningful with her life. I honestly wish I had that strength of character. But there were also times when my very practical side wanted to slap her and Liam silly for not talking, exploring options and trying to find some kind of middle ground.It&amp;#8217;s really great reading about the previous couples and characters in the team. Their family like bond and their support in this particular book shone through.I was so glad I got to read more about Jamie Babcock, having him living with Kally. He&amp;#8217;s still young enough to be completely cute and adorable but also old enough to be an alpha male with his very own Babs signature.Liam and Noelle&amp;#8217;s story blew me away with the amount of emotions it stirred. A couple of times bringing me to tears. It moved me and left me wanting to make a difference myself.This is the third book in the Portland Storm series. You could probably read it without reading the previous books but you would be missing out on the characters that appear as secondary in this book. I strongly suggest you read the series in order.And for those of you who are Tammy Falkner fans and follow her Reed Brothers series, can you guess where Liam gets his tattoos at?&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Sweet, sexy and inspiring&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1402876800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 16, 2014&quot;}</td>

This book has helped us figure out ways of cutting down on the clutter and condensing the stuff we have to a much more manageable level. I never knew where to begin so would just give up on minimizing the clutter, and instead would just want to move again to a bigger place. We now do not have to move again! We have finally found a sure fire way to maximize our space, and it has made our stress levels plummet! I didn&#39;t even realize that the source of our stress was the clutter everywhere.

There is a good story line here and there is a lot of sex but unlike some &amp;#34;romance&amp;#34; books I have read it doesn&#39;t go on and on (and sometimes on) with the sex. This of course just depends on the author.  There is sex and there is an okay amount of detail about the sex but I have read romances where the sex could span two or three pages and quite frankly I can only read so much of how the hero takes his velvet steel into her moist folds before I just decide to skip ahead.Now that I&#39;m clear about the fact that there is sex here I&#39;ll also tell you that for most of this book I was wondering how the heck was this going to resolve!  I too was feeling torn!The book does require some editing I&#39;ll have to admit but it&#39;s really not something that should impact your enjoyment of the book. They say a strong mind is able to figure out what is meant to be said and any noticeable errors only occur occasionally.There are some great twists in this book, and  a really good ending which doesn&#39;t leave me going &amp;#34;What?

Orduna\&quot;&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [2, 2], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;Much like Dracula, the zombie genre has been done to death. Finding new ways to have a good story is tough, especially when so many have done it already. Marie F Crow does something that many other authors don&amp;#8217;t, she grabs your attention and tells you a story that is beyond the scope of your traditional zombie narrative. Sure there are components that you will find with others, but what really throws you for a loop here is the main character and the scope of the larger picture.Much like &amp;#8220;Walking Dead&amp;#8221; features a great deal of emotion, Helena (the main character) is a catalyst for so many points of fear, regret, life, and so much more. Crow finds a way of establishing this character, deeply rooted in emotion, so when she goes through the story, you&amp;#8217;re floored with excitement.It&amp;#8217;s hard not to shed a tear at some points, as some of the family bonding, even within the scope of a motorcycle club begins to pull at your heartstrings. Mixing &amp;#8220;Sons of Anarchy&amp;#8221; with &amp;#8220;The Walking Dead&amp;#8221; is about as close as I can come to trying to tell you what this narrative is like. It&amp;#8217;s multi-layered, has zombies, but grips your heart with a certain horror that is missing from a lot of other zombie tales. I found it intrepid, compelling, and worth a second read, just not in the dark. My cat scared me while reading. There&amp;#8217;s a lot of good found in this one. If you like zombies, you&amp;#8217;ll love it, and if you&amp;#8217;re an avid reader, then this is another instant classic to add to your kindle collection, no joke.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;The Risen Packs a Serious Punch For More Than Just Zombie Fans&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1391731200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 7, 2014&quot;}</td>

However, I decided to give this novel a try, and I was extremely impressed with the juggling act that Oren Sanderson puts on throughout the storyline. He is very skilled with having a multitude of aspects in the plot, such as politics, love, mystery, and many others, but not lose interest in the main story line.Dancing bear was completely captivating and kept me reading to the very last page. The fact that it is extremely well written and organized definitely benefited the complexity of the storyline. The characters are very well developed. I definitely could relate with David and wondered if that woman could be trusted. I found myself thinking I knew what was going to happen, and then something else completely caught me off guard.Most of all, I love the thrill of the chase that this book provides its reader. I feel like I am constantly chasing after the answers and sometimes I feel somewhat like David chasing after Kate. When books hand you the answers to the questions right away, it makes the book less exciting. Let me tell you this book is the complete opposite!Overall, I was extremely happy with this book and I would definitely recommend this book to my friends and family.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;The thrill of this chase will keep you reading until the last page!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1396569600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 4, 2014&quot;}</td>

I found it a bit ponderous, at least for my 12-year-old taste, and my parents thought it might be too \&quot;mature\&quot; for a little kid.  So my mother went to our local library and borrowed \&quot;City Boy,\&quot; telling me I&#39;d love it.She was absolutely right, although I took umbrage at identifying myself as a \&quot;Herbie.\&quot;  Unlike the book&#39;s protagonist, I was big and strong for my age and a decent athlete who could hit a baseball a mile (catching it was a different story) and who could take care of himself, so I tried to think of myself as a \&quot;Lennie\&quot; (the big, dumb kid who was Herbie&#39;s rival) although I found his character a bit repulsive, as he was a bully and I (generally) wasn&#39;t. I paid little attention to the subplot involving Lucille Glass (I wasn&#39;t yet interested in girls), and even less to that involving the attempted buyout of \&quot;The Place,\&quot; the ice factory co-owned by Herbie and Lennie&#39;s fathers, and by a silent partner, Mr. Powers.  The following year, I went to a sleepaway camp much like Camp Manitou, and with my bunkmates at Bunk 9, put a few of Herbie&#39;s ideas into play.  By that time my interest in the opposite sex started to manifest itself.  Did it ever.Recently I bought \&quot;City Boy\&quot; along with \&quot;The Caine Mutiny\&quot; and \&quot;Marjorie Morningstar\&quot; (which my wife is reading for the second time), and I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that despite the fact that I could hit a spaldeen 3 sewers as a kid, I was very much a Herbie, then and now, who would soon develop his hopeless crush on his very own Lucille Glass -- actually two of them--sequentially and many years separated, both of whom I met at yet another summer camp.  (One of the two even grew up in the Bronx, not all that far in distance from Mosholu Parkway where Lucille lived but light-years away demographically and culturally.)Like Herbie, I was that lad who would ride in the front car of the subway with his buddies, noses pressed up against the glass by the motorman&#39;s cab as we watched the train fly through the tunnel as we headed towards Ebbets Field in Brooklyn where we would emerge into dazzling sunlight at the Prospect Park station to watch the immortal Duke blast frozen ropes onto Bedford Avenue before the great No. 4 and the other Dodgers would desert us for the purported Sybaritic paradise of La-la Land.  The crushes would come a couple years later, and last forever.  I suspect Herbie, now 97, still has a thing for 96-year-old Lucille.Let&#39;s briefly summarize the plot:  1928. Herbie Bookbinder, a precocious and manipulative 11-year-old a year ahead of his class in school, develops a crush on a little girl, Lucille Glass, a grade behind him.  Lucille tells Herbie she&#39;s going to attend Camp Manitou, a kid&#39;s summer camp in the Berkshires run by Mr. Gauss, the school&#39;s principal.  Herbie wheedles his parents into letting him go there.  Also attending will be Lennie Krieger, a lunkheaded 13-year-old who&#39;s a year behind his class, and about to be left back again. Herbie&#39;s father and Lennie&#39;s father are co-owners of an ice-making business called \&quot;The Place,, and there&#39;s an Irish silent partner named Powers who may or may not own a controlling interest in the business, and who wants to sell it to a third party so he can cover some bad outside investments.  Lucille&#39;s father is an attorney who represents the business, but seems to represent Powers more than the other two partners.Herbie gets to camp, and quickly learns it&#39;s no paradise; \&quot;Uncle\&quot; Gauss is far more interested in turning a profit by cutting corners than in molding childrens&#39; characters.  Moreover, Herbie&#39;s a lousy athlete, and is taunted by the older boys, with the bullying led by Lennie.  Herbie, in an effort to impress Lucille, wants to build an amusement park-type ride for the camp&#39;s Mardi Gras Day, but the materials to build it will cost $50 (equivalent to $1,000 today) which he doesn&#39;t have.  How to get the money?  Steal it from his dad&#39;s safe (Herbie knows the combination); then leave a promissory note guaranteeing repayment.  In an mad series of adventures, Herbie and his cousin Cliff sneak out of camp, hitchhike the 100 miles back to the Bronx in the middle of the night, only to find Mr. Bookbinder and his partners engaged in an acrimonious discussion about selling off the company.  When the men are somehow distracted, Herbie and Cliff steal $50 from the thousands in the safe, hightail it out of there, and hitch back to Camp Manitou before reveille the next morning, without anyone noticing.  Herbie, assisted by Cliff, a broken-down horse, and the camp&#39;s handyman, who turns out to be Herbie&#39;s mentor, builds his ride. It&#39;s a big success, making far more than the $50 cost of materials, and most important, Herbie finally impresses the \&quot;fickle\&quot; Lucille.  But Herbie&#39;s troubles are only beginning, and the conclusion of the story brings the three legs of the plot together.One thing I really liked was that Herbie and his pals navigated the NYC subway system by themselves at age 11, just as I did back in the &#39;50&#39;s.  NYC, including the subways, has become as safe as it was 55 years ago, but most parents think it&#39;s still 1990 and riding the subway is as dangerous as being in Afghanistan.  Today, if an 11-year-old is seen riding the subway, Child Protective Services will accuse his parents of neglect.  Another thing that I totally agreed with was that Wouk, without explicitly saying so, is opposed to smart kids skipping grades.  Herbie was 1 1/2 years ahead intellectually, but socially and physically he was still only 11, which is especially troublesome for boys.  Fortunately, the NYC school system has largely abandoned this.In conclusion, I found the story far more entertaining as an adult than I did as a child, and I loved it back then.  Yet I can&#39;t give it 5 stars, as much as I&#39;d like to, because Wouk is overly on-the-nose in drumming the story&#39;s moral - the ends don&#39;t justify the means - into the innocent and not-so-innocent readers.  In the Caine Mutiny, where there are more than 50 shades of grey to describe the characters of the ensemble cast (including Lt. Commander Queeq), Wouk lets their actions do the moralizing, rather than editorialize. That said, I whole-heartedly recommend this for children of all ages, and would grade this 4 1/2 stars if I could.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;I Read Two Different Books; Once at Age 12, the Second More than 50 Years Later&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1393977600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 5, 2014&quot;}</td>

The perfect set-up for a thriller&amp;#8212;crack for readers. And it only got better once I started the book.At the beginning, I was concerned with the plethora of characters and viewpoints, which often turns a novel into a confusion of characters where you have to turn back to earlier chapters to remember who is who. But Chris Pavone does a great job of making each character memorable enough to keep straight.It is the choices of these characters that drive an intricate plot, which unwinds in a frenetic twenty-four hour period. Not only are the plot and characters well-written, the writing itself is clean and free of the clich&amp;eacute;s that often find their way into thrillers.The Accident is a perfect weekend read or, in my case, excellent treadmill reading. And I have to give five stars to any book that makes me lose track of how far I&amp;#8217;ve run.(I was given a free copy of this novel in exchange for an honest review.)&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Crack for Readers&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1404172800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;07 1, 2014&quot;}</td>

I read it and it read more like a mystery/thriller in the beginning. Carson is a detective investigating a homicide, a pile of bones and ash found in a parking garage. Once they identify who it is, the mystery begins as he pieces together the events leading up to the crime. Miriam is in a horribly abusive relationship and tries to leave Ben, but he won&#39;t let her go. Then Jack comes to her rescue and while they get to know each other, they fall hard for one another. But Miriam has no idea the strength and power she has within her and what she can do with that power. I highly recommend this book! If you haven&#39;t read paranormal before, this is a good book to start with. I am looking forward to reading the next book in this series, &amp;#34;Djinn and Tonic&amp;#34;. Keep writing, Jasinda and I will keep reading! :)&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Jasinda Wilder writes Paranormal and it is awesome!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1405296000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;07 14, 2014&quot;}</td>

The story is about a family in a small southern town called Heaven, Louisiana.The heroine is Schyler Crandall who has returned home to Heaven from London, where she escaped to after her sister, Tricia betrays her.  Schyler has come back to the family home named Belle Terre, an old southern home that she loves, because her father has had a major heart attack.  Since her father is in the hospital, Schyler takes on the family business.The book is heavy on very crass language and sex scenes.  If you are looking for a romance novel, then this book is hot what I would call romantic, The romantic involvement for Schyler is a Cajun who lives on the bayou, Cash Boudreaux.  He is as foul mouthed and crude as they come.  How any woman could find anything romantic about this man is beyound me.There are a number of other sex scenes with other characters that I basically skipped over.  I am not a blushing virgin and I have read many romance novels in the past but this one is so crass that I was even appalled.Also for dog lovers, this book has a pit bull fight that I could not read.  Cruelty to animals and to people is another reason that I did not like this book.  Also stereotypes abound about the south in this book that are so overdone as to be silly.&amp;#34;Slow Heat in Heaven&amp;#34; is one of Sandra Brown&#39;s earlier novels; I will stick to reading her more current books because they have more appeal to me.  This one barely earns that two stars that I am giving it.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 2.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Pass on this one!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1389484800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 12, 2014&quot;}</td>

It is filled with drama, heartbreak, and love. Oh yeah it also has plenty of crazy, funny moments by the Parker sisters.Cambree is off at college and has agreed to meet up with Max but other things take place which leads to Cambree being attacked. Cambree knows who is responsible for the attack on her, the pycho who has been torturing the Parker family for years, Brent. Even though Cambree is strong, this attack has pushed her to the one man that broke her heart, Max Baird. Her love for him never changed, but she just couldn&#39;t deal with all secrets and lies Max fed her. Cambree will not give in to easily to Max, he must prove himself.Max feels guilty about Cambree&#39;s attack, he was supposed to be protecting her, but in turn brought her into harms way. Max knows he screwed up in the past, and is determined to make it up to Cambree. He wants to start their relationship right this time with no lies and no secrets. Until everything can be revealed he has to hold back expressing the way he truly feels about Cambree, but is still going to be by her side no matter what. He will protect her this time, no more slip ups.As Max and Mitch work on a case against Brent, more secrets are revealed that may help them catching Brent and putting him away for good. Mitch has his own secret that he needs to tell the family but isn&#39;t for sure how or when he should tell them. Max and Mitch have to make tough decisions about what to tell the Parker family, because just they know any deviation in their plans could risk everything they have built up in the case so far.Even though there is so much drama going on with the Parker gang, they all no how to act crazy and have fun when the moment is right. The women in the family are strong-willed and sassy, while their men support them and know when to back down. I seriously love the things that come out the Parker sister&#39;s mouths, it is hilarious. I love the multiple POVs from all the family during the book. After following the Parker gang since the beginning of the series I feel like I&#39;m apart of the family. I loved how Cambree and Max&#39;s story ended. I can&#39;t wait to read Dustin&#39;s story.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Awesome Series!!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1399248000, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 5, 2014&quot;}</td>

Eskildson \&quot;Pragmatist\&quot;&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [31, 52], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;We all remember that Hillary lost to Obama in 2008. In &#39;Hard Choices&#39; she tells us that she then planned to return to the Senate and was surprised when Obama offered the Secretary of State position to her. Supposedly she liked the idea of following one of her heroes, William Seward - another N.Y. senator who lost out to the ultimate president (Lincoln), and then served in his cabinet. (Who ever heard of William Seward? And why the focus on &#39;political heroes&#39; instead of the opportunity to better America?) We&#39;re supposed to believe that personal political calculation had nothing to do with her acceptance - &#39;When your President asks you to serve, you should say Yes.&#39;Hillary&#39;s narration shows her as consistently hawkish, consistent with her previously insisting on serving on the Armed Services Committee while a senator, and voting for the Iraq War. But I also saw her as constantly sticking her nose into every other nation&#39;s affairs - to the point she came across as domineering and insulting; not surprisingly, she doesn&#39;t see it that way in &#39;Hard Choices.&#39;As for Benghazi, it&#39;s lot of double-talk, taking all positions at the same time, but failing to address the question of &#39;Why did the U.S. even have a State Dept. office in a non-capital city in Libya?&#39; Putin - he&#39;s a bad guy, but she fails to see that his help is essential in addressing problems in Syria and Iran, issues with Russian hackers interfering with U.S. commerce and Internet traffic, and probably Iraq. Thus, her/our demonizing him (and others) simply makes progress in other areas more difficult, if not impossible. Pivoting to Asia - another demonizing tactic that supposedly makes America (and Hillary) look tough, but makes little sense. Today we&#39;re seeking help from Iran to stem the Sunni uprising in Iraq. We need China&#39;s ongoing help (and that of others) to address Global Warming; on the other hand, we also need to stop letting Asia in general (and China in particular) decimate our economy. Free Trade is working - for them, not us. Regardless, who in America wants to risk losing eg. L.A. and Seattle to defend some miniscule island in the Pacific, thousands of miles away?We also get the cloy ploy for sympathy - &#39;there&#39;s a double standard applied to women in politics.&#39; Tell that to Angela Merkel and others.Overall, &#39;Hard Choices&#39; is rather boring and overly vague on specifics. Meanwhile, her political spin continues - this week it&#39;s a lame explanation of why she charges so much for speaking engagements.If anybody out there doesn&#39;t think &#39;Hard Choices&#39; isn&#39;t a planned step on the road to the 2016 nomination, I&#39;ve got a lot of bridges I&#39;d like to sell you.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 1.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;It&#39;s Really Hard To Take What This Woman Writes at Face Value&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1402617600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 13, 2014&quot;}</td>

When one of the two suspects is quickly found murdered, the Leggetts&#39; story about what really happened begins to unravel. As it does, the past and the present slowly reveal themselves in a quagmire of trouble.For most novels, this would be enough material to fill one book, but for Dashiell Hammett, this is only the first of three parts that become steadily darker and seedier as the story progresses. The key figure in the book is Gabrielle Leggett, the confused, aloof daughter plagued by her own demons. Just when the Continental Op thinks he&#39;s done with the family, he&#39;s asked to watch over Gabrielle who&#39;s recovering from tragedy at a Temple, which appears to be a religious cult. From there, things only get worse.What can I say about Dashiell Hammett that hasn&#39;t already been said? Having read his work after so many years, I understand why he&#39;s considered one of the masters of the detective novel. It was a welcome change to read mystery that&#39;s kicking it old style. There&#39;s no hi-tech gimmicks in this story, just a lot of leg work and--on the downside--some sexism and racist slurs that were prevalent back then. Still, this whodunit will keep you guessing as hidden agendas and connections make a simple plot increasingly complex. Having said that, the twisted motivations and secret relationships in this book became so extensive that it stretched credibility by the end, however this won&#39;t deter us true Hammett fans from reading more of his work.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Complex Story From One of the Best&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1394236800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;03 8, 2014&quot;}</td>

I loved all the twists and turns it took.  While the romance was as good as I&#39;ve come to expect from this series, I have to say that I found the advancements in the overall story arc for the series equally compelling.Jessica and Travis were a great couple.  They had me laughing, sighing at the tender moments and groaning over their mutual stubbornness.  Before I go much further, I should point out that this one is very much connected to the ones that came before it.  It assumes the reader is familiar with the history of several people and the ongoing situation that makes them time travelers.Jessica Battaglia is a nurse at a hospital in Harrisburg and her life leaves her content with the exception of painful situation of her grandfather walking away from his marriage and taking up with a much younger woman.  She can&#39;t forgive him for this and doesn&#39;t trust his new wife, but she agrees to come to dinner along with her best friend, Hailey for moral support.  At the dinner, all goes wrong and she ends up accused of murdering her own grandfather and taken into custody even while her friend is taken to the hospital because Eve drugged them.  While sitting in the interrogation room, something weird happens and she blacks out only to end up in the countryside almost a hundred and fifty years before her time trying to convince a guy that she&#39;s not crazy.Travis Wade, a Union deserter and thought dead, is making his way back to his uncle in Harrisburg to get his help when he stumbles on a crazy beautiful woman who thinks she&#39;s from the future.  It&#39;s not long before he learns that her bizarre story is indeed the truth when he encounters more time travelers just like her and they all know his uncle and his brother.  His life is turned upside down and his attraction to Jessica is at the center of this.  Each time he is near her though he ends up saying or doing the wrong stuff that causes an argument.  He has no idea what to do and recognizes that if he doesn&#39;t figure it out quick, she&#39;ll leave him behind to return to her own time.Jessica is all stirred up when it comes to Travis and she doesn&#39;t know what to think about the irritating man who both makes her go weak at the knees and gives her the urge to hit him all at the same time.  She has the added distraction of worrying what is going on with her grandfather&#39;s murder and her friend&#39;s precarious survival in her absence.  Her heart is divided and she has no idea what to do.In the meantime, she is enjoying the camaraderie and family of people who have taken her into their life and made her one of their own.  Sophie and Jamie kindly do all they can for her and Travis, Em and Hannah are busy with babies and pregnancies and they&#39;re all caught up in the events brought on by the War.  The mysterious Madame and others are at work in the shadows orchestrating things that effect everyone&#39;s lives.As I said earlier, the plot on this one was loaded with action and suspense which I loved.  The pace moved along pretty good.  I enjoyed the reveals about the bad guys&#39; plottings.  Jessica and Travis were key figures that the good guys had to protect and the bad guys take out for the opposing people to get their victories.  The murder plot in the contemporary time just made things even more exciting.As to the romance and characters of Jessica and Travis, I really liked it for the most part.  They were both so stubborn and unwilling to see the other&#39;s perspective at times that I got frustrated.  And there was a period where denial of feelings caused stupid setbacks for them, but fortunately they had Sophie and Jamie around to knock some sense into their heads.  I suppose all the conflict leading up to the resolve just made the resolve that much sweeter.It was fun to get a peek in with everyone else as they all played a big part in the story including Crow and Shaye in the future.  Looking forward to what comes next.This book and the series it is part of would appeal to those who enjoy sweeter romances in a time-travel situation that is spent mostly in the American Civil War era.My thanks to the author for gifting me a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review thoughts.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Rivals My Favorites in the Series For Romance and Suspense&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1390089600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 19, 2014&quot;}</td>

Based on the plot and writing of this one, I would be willing to check out the first book from the library. I can&#39;t say I was head over heels in love to want to buy it.Jaycee missed the last text of her best friend Rachel&#39;s life, caught up in her first kiss and lingering anger from a fight between the girls six months previously. This haunts her as she starts to believe there was more to Rachel&#39;s death than is being shared and confirmed when she receives unlikely aid from a friend of Rachel&#39;s, sending her down a path of gangs, hazing initiations, jealousy, and racial tensions in a small insular Washington town.For me, this book&#39;s big strength was its fast-paced. I read it all in one frantic day, barely able to put it down as each chapter only impelled me to read further. I credit this to the writing and plotting of Wolf-she really kept me on the edge of my seat.Also of interest was peeling back the layers of racism and mistrust between the old timers of the small town and the migrant workers, some of whom may be there illegally. When Rachel is murdered, it is all too easy to lay the blame at the feet of someone who allegedly has ties to a gang or whose skin is a different color from yours. I&#39;m not sure this was handled as thoroughly as it could have been but it might be enlightening for some people and it helped to ratchet up the tension in the beginning of the book.But its weakness for me was its timid and naive narrator, though as the book progresses the reader gets a sense of her strong moral fortitude. I guess you could compare her to Fanny Price of Mansfield Park. She lives within her father&#39;s stringent rules and doesn&#39;t try to push the bounds of what it means to be a good girl, accepting her fate as one of the uncool. But her best friend considers her the best person she knows, someone who knows right from wrong and will diligently work to expose the truth and render justice (not vengeance, a key distinction). Saying that, even as I admire those kinds of people, they don&#39;t tend to be my favorite book characters. I like a bit more flamboyance and wit a la Elizabeth Bennet. The naivety is especially frustrating when it came to the culprit; I started having my suspicions probably later than others but it was eons before Jaycee with her trusting heart.Overall: I am eager to hear the opinion of people who have read Wolf&#39;s previous outing as well as those who are well-versed in YA mystery/thrillers. How do you think this stacks up? Personally I think this is a can-miss. Give it a read if the concept sounds intriguing to you but otherwise, don&#39;t feel bad about passing over it.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;A review from Bookworm1858&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1389484800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 12, 2014&quot;}</td>

What it has is SHORT, SWEET and UNIQUE because it has quotes from famous people like Taylor Swift and even Abraham Lincoln. After each quote is a mini lesson on how to apply this quote into your life.There are 30 SUPERB quotes by famous people and found that in one way or another, all 30 are helpful.My favorite quote and mini lesson is:* Number 1 by Henry Ford: Whether you think you can or think you can&#39;t you&#39;re right. How true this quote is! And I liked it so much, I put it on a 3 x 5 card in my bathroom and use the I CAN part of this, what a wonderful quote!This is a MUST READ book because it is small and so MEANINGFUL and so HELPFUL. At the low price of just about one dollar, it is worth the purchase!Highly recommend this book!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Famous quotes by famous people - short book with great food for thought!&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1389139200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 8, 2014&quot;}</td>

It was a bit over the top and then there was no resolution of that part of the story.  I wanted to know what happened to him and his cronies.

It was almost insulting to read the line (paraphrasing here), &amp;#34;I checked to make sure I had weapons...and all that.&amp;#34; Pretty far removed from John Rain. No details on the plan, type of knife, exploring the angles and options for implementing his plan. The fight sequences with the Russians read like a bad movie plot. Trading face punches? No judo or grips and holds?

Who do we have in the field that can check on this further?&amp;#8221; Avery asks when an American plane is shot down over the Sea of Japan in the beginning of Steve Wilson&amp;#8217;s novel, &amp;#34;Red Sky at Morning.&amp;#34;This first book in the Michael Neill Adventure series targets readers who like military strategy, nuclear warfare, and political intrigue in current day scenarios. With no profanity or sexual scenes, this Christian-based story includes violence due to the topic of nuclear destruction.In this tome, United States First Lieutenant Michael Neill grew up with his missionary parents in the Ukraine but has not returned to the country for over eight years. As a Marine, he speaks several languages working as a Marine in the Security Forces Squadron.When his military friend&amp;#8217;s plane flies too low near the Russian coastline due to inclement weather and is shot down by a fighter plane with stealth technology, Neill is heart-broken of his friend&amp;#8217;s demise but knows God is in control. Yet on the broad scale, other governments want their own control and power in the former Soviet Union area, especially when it involves nuclear weapons.Ordered by the Unites States, the Marine&amp;#8217;s instructions are to verify the status of thirty-six C-type nuclear warheads that are to be disassembled at the Odessa plant in the Ukraine. Added to his duties, he must uncover information about the sixth-generation stealth fighter that killed his comrade.While Neill meets up with his old Ukrainian friend, Andrei Ulyanov, who now runs the disarmament program at Odessa, the two Christian men pray for wisdom and guidance when they learn one warhead is missing. Realizing it could be a dirty bomb or full-fledge nuke, they, along with a persistent beautiful journalist, try to anticipate where two Russians who want to restore the old Soviet Union have hidden the deadly device.Counting down to detonation, readers become engaged in the military espionage and patriotism for one&amp;#8217;s homeland as pages turn quickly to find out if this time there will be radiological dispersion. As a well-written, technical military tale, Wilson set up a great series where one man&amp;#8217;s faith in God is consistent as he deals with others on a personal or global level.Thanks to CWA Review Crew for furnishing this book in exchange for a review of the reader&amp;#8217;s honest opinion.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Having Faith During Ukrainian Nuke Crisis&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1389398400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 11, 2014&quot;}</td>

Shrimp aquariums don&#39;t seem common and that, perhaps, is because it appears more difficult that it actually is. Gordon Monock demystifies how hard it is to step up a shrimp aquarium in this easy to follow guide. He covers why to consider shrimp as pets, to feeding them and how to breed them. It&#39;s a pretty informative, while being concise guide.

He certainly knows how to make your spine tingle.  He stands with the most popular authors of this genre as he writes another gripping suspense.  Sacred rituals await a teenaged girl as the villain scopes her out at the mall watching her dance around her boyfriend.  That evening George Madden drops off his wife, Edna, at the weekly prayer meeting.  As usual, he has his own weekly meeting at the prostitute club, \&quot;Silk Stockings.\&quot;  After he gets his satisfaction, it&#39;s hard for him to see while driving on the dark country road at night.  However, as he glances toward a stand of trees, he notices a person dressed in all white running and stumbling through the trees.  He stops, grabs a flashlight, and works his way through the brambles to find a young girl, barely breathing, laying on the ground.  He hoists her over his shoulder to his car and takes her to the hospital. He feels he&#39;s likely to be in deep do-do when he has to explain this to his wife Edna. Doctor Sydia Garrison who specializes in surgery at Medical University of South Carolina is sickened by the barbaric assault on this young teenager.  A local news reporter, Janice Porter, gets a tip from a fellow who works at the hospital, so she quickly attempts to be the lead reporter and goes to the hospital.  There she sees the infamous Detective Dan Hammer who has a strong dislike for reporters, which only hampers her a bit to get a report to her boss. Very soon, as the police search the area where George found the mutilated girl, another young girl&#39;s body is found.  This leads to FBI Agent Harry Wright into the fast moving investigation of the serial killer tagged, \&quot;The Mutilator.\&quot;  This is very compelling story, with the characters well defined, in fast reading style of writing by the author.  One can&#39;t help read this story non-stop to the very end to see when and if the trauma ends. Highly recommend this suspenseful thriller.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;\&quot;An Awesome Psychological Crime Thriller\&quot;&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1400457600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 19, 2014&quot;}</td>

While later books still have him as the Commander in Chief, these three are in my opinion, the best.  I was surprised how much I&#39;d forgotten and how much I thoroughly enjoyed these!  I encourage all who have long ago read and &amp;#34;put down&amp;#34; these great Tom Clancy thrillers, to &amp;#34;pick them back up&amp;#34; - now of course in the form of your Kindle.

Fans of both the dystopian and New Adult romance genres will definitely want to read this exceptional story!Opening Sentence: The dream was changing.The Review:Ember and Chase have gone through hell to be together. The Moral Militia. The Rehabilitation Center. Secrets and betrayals by people they once considered friends. The number of people they&amp;#8217;ve watched die. Yet nothing has come as close to truly separating them as the emotional scars they both carry after shooting a young guard in Chicago while rescuing Rebecca.After all, it&amp;#8217;s not like they can take a time out to talk about Chase&amp;#8217;s darkest secrets or Ember&amp;#8217;s greatest fear. With the only safe house they knew of destroyed, their small group of survivors from the MM attack is scrambling to find a place to recover. Ember, Chase, Rebecca, Sean and four others have set out from a temporary shelter to find supplies and a better hiding spot for those injured during the tunnel collapse. No one is happy about leaving the weakest, virtually defenseless members of their group behind and they all feel the pressure to return by the promised deadline only a few days away.  Ember, Chase and the rest have barely had time to sleep, let alone hold any private soul-bearing conversations and their hope is fading fast. The only thing keeping any of them going is the hope that Tucker and the two carriers who went with him can find a rebellion post in the Red Zone.The news from Tucker isn&amp;#8217;t good when he finally makes contact with Ember though. The first rebellion post is deserted. The news that one of the carriers, the name given to members of the rebellion who deliver messages between posts, is missing is even worse. Tucker is clearly worried about the situation, however most of his concern seems to be focused on Ember &amp;#8211; something which makes things with Chase even tenser. Despite their issues, it&amp;#8217;s clear Ember loves Chase and vice versa. Still, she can&amp;#8217;t deny her feelings for the guy who both betrayed Chase and murdered her mother. She doesn&amp;#8217;t want to be concerned about his safety or feel relief at hearing his voice&amp;#8230;except she does. Tucker has proven himself several times over and Ember unwillingly feels a softening in her heart toward him.Rather than think too long about the odd Tucker situation, her strained friendship with Rebecca or even the worry she feels over Chase pulling away from her, Ember instead focuses on a trail of subtle clues possibly left by the rebel group known as Three. Ember is certain Three is the key to unifying the rebellion groups &amp;#8211; the only hope they have to defeat the President and his Bureau of Reformation. The only problem? No one knows for sure if Three exists or how to get in contact with them. Ember is sure they are getting closer to the elusive group and is convinced they just need more time to find them. For as much guilt and concern Ember felt up to this point for leaving the injured people behind, she&amp;#8217;s pretty quick to talk the others into following the trail of clues rather than returning by the promised deadline. I understand her reasoning &amp;#8211; finding Three would benefit them much more than simply turning around &amp;#8211; but this still seems like a harsh decision. It reflects how much she&amp;#8217;s changed since Article 5, how all of them have become hardened to the world of Statutes and murder sentences for single mothers.This change is further emphasized when Ember&amp;#8217;s group is ambushed. These may not be MM members yet she reminds herself that anyone attacking her is her enemy. At least it appears that way, until the other group&amp;#8217;s leader is revealed to be a man from Chase&amp;#8217;s past. A dangerous man who has the power to hurt Chase more than he already has. Afraid Chase will push her even further away if she reveals her true feelings regarding the guy; Ember instead stays silent on the sudden reappearance of the man she trusts less than Tucker. The only good news is the rest of the people with him are rebels who survived another safe house attack.The story, which was in no way slow up to this point, really starts to fly once Ember&amp;#8217;s group meets up with these survivors. It&amp;#8217;s hard to talk about the rest of the story without giving anything away though. What I can say is there are a lot of hard lessons learned when they eventually do find the mysterious Three. Secret agendas and more deaths &amp;#8211; several of which left me a sobbing mess &amp;#8211; keep the tension almost unbearably high for the rest of the book, making it very difficult to put it down for even a moment. There are double and triple crosses, but the killer is that there aren&amp;#8217;t purely good or purely evil aspects for most characters or their actions. The will to survive can make people do things they never imagined they could to make it one more hour, one more day. There are plot twists I saw coming and others that completely surprised me.None of the relationships in Three are simple, but there were a number of sweet moments that warmed my heart. Ember and Chase&amp;#8217;s relationship is definitely one of the more beautiful ones I&amp;#8217;ve read in a while. They&amp;#8217;ve both changed so much since the first book, yet their love has only deepened. The tenderness Simmons is able to portray between Ember and Chase, and to a greater extent Rebecca and Sean, is refreshing and unique in Young Adult and New Adult pieces where physical attraction is the primary focus. Finally, I&amp;#8217;d be lying if I didn&amp;#8217;t admit how heartbreaking the ending was for me. I don&amp;#8217;t think there&amp;#8217;s any other way Simmons could&amp;#8217;ve done her remarkable story justice though.Three may be the first book I&amp;#8217;ve ever whole-heartedly and universally recommended for everyone with no thought as to what genre it should be placed in. Though there are sexual situations and violence in the trilogy, the overall story belongs among social commentary classics like Fahrenheit 451.Notable Scene:&amp;#8220;Why are they here?&amp;#8221; I asked, suddenly angry at them &amp;#8212; the dead people. They shouldn&amp;#8217;t have scared me. I&amp;#8217;d seen worse. Much worse.&amp;#8220;Let&amp;#8217;s go get some air,&amp;#8221; he said.I peeled his fingers away.&amp;#8220;Why didn&amp;#8217;t they clear out like everyone else?&amp;#8221; There wasn&amp;#8217;t any sign of violence; it was like they&amp;#8217;d laid down to sleep and not woken up, and for some reason this bothered me even more.&amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t know.&amp;#8221;&amp;#8220;They should have evacuated.&amp;#8221; The government had cleared this area years ago.I swiped at my arms again, feeling the tickle on my skin.&amp;#8220;Maybe they didn&amp;#8217;t want to.&amp;#8221; He chewed his bottom lip, looking into the room.His words shifted my fear to something more solid, something stronger. I&amp;#8217;d had it backward. These people hadn&amp;#8217;t given up, they&amp;#8217;d made their stand. Maybe that was all we really got: a choice to control our own fate.FTC Advisory: Tor Teen/Macmillan provided me with a copy of Three. No goody bags, sponsorships, &amp;#8220;material connections,&amp;#8221; or bribes were exchanged for my review.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Three is my favorite book in the gritty Article 5 trilogy&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1401753600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 3, 2014&quot;}</td>

I was over Annie about three chapters in.  It grates my patience to read about a beautiful smart heroine who is strong in all her decision making except when it comes to trusting her emotions.  She goes for what she wants but not romantic happiness.  The author could have been erotic and sensual without the brazen profanity.  I think it negated the sexiness of the scenes.

It was such a sad outcome but at the end it was also some what happy. It was a tough decision that both these people made in order for there children to survive in a world that is close to ending. This book really does portray what might happen to us in the future. So many problems with the environment and so many people having longer lives. Will there be an epic disease like the black plague that most people will not be able to overcome. It was great that they both found each other even if it was for two hours before they ended up dyeing. Love is always there even when you are not looking for it.

Regardless of how adventurous most of us consider ourselves to be in the world of culinary delights, eating bugs doesn&#39;t exactly sound like the catch of the day.The author takes a look at hunger, culture, the work of other governments in entomophagy, the actual nutrition that bugs contain, and lots more.  The casual conversational style of her writing makes Martin&#39;s book interesting and easy to understand.  While I am not sure personally that bugs are what&#39;s for dinner here tonight, I can easily see the advantages of a readily available food source that is easily sustainable and can basically be grown anywhere.For me, it brought up a more interesting train of thought....why do I think bugs are so disgusting to eat?  How culturally brainwashed am I?  It&#39;s food for thought, for sure.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Interesting Look At Creepy Crawlies&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1397606400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 16, 2014&quot;}</td>

Evocative descriptions draw the reader swiftly into its world of deception and espionage, one which damaged heroine Nikki Siriene may not fully yet comprehend.Be prepared for a level of eroticism most thrillers won&#39;t touch - in fact, it&#39;s rare that when a book gets this dirty, there&#39;s room for a plot at all. Somehow, though, Hennessy makes it work.

Karissa has no money and her only family is her mom.  Her mother is paranoid and Karissa believes she is somewhat mentally unstable.  She is also a recluse. Karissa meets our hero Naz when he is in her classroom speaking to one of her professors.  Shaking him down actually but Karissa does not know this. And that is how they meet. Naz isn&#39;t just some handsome stranger.  He is a very dangerous man. And he wants Karissa. This book ends in a cliffhanger that was so delicious!I devoured every word of this book.  I loved Naz so much and I was a little afraid of him too.  I especially loved how the author did not do the insta love connection.  Naz&#39;s possessiveness comes to a slow boil and you are just like the lobster...you don&#39;t know its to late until...well its to late.  Karissa is a bit immature and a bit trusting but it is believable for her age and situation.  I mean what young girl on her own wouldn&#39;t want to be around a dark and sexy man.  And he is dark.  And dangerous.  And sexy.  But the author does a great job of allowing the reader to learn these things along with Karissa.  We are not told what a bad ass he is.  We are not told how violent and deadly.  But we learn and we realize like someone in her shoes. Karissa had realistic and believable reactions to everything Naz did.  And Naz...oh man...you do not walk away from this man.  I am praying that the author keeps up his alpha domineering ways in the next book. I want the dark. I want the scary and shocking.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Just so yummy!  Perfect alpha male&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1400457600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 19, 2014&quot;}</td>

But, this story would run very well if it ever went to screen.The characters are still very well written and the flow of the story is what I like. It is able to jump forward and back in time to look at a characters storyline without losing your attention.The space battles and tactics read well too, easy to visualize what is going on even though space is vast.Well done Jasper.<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>overall<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-c1">5.0</span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>summary<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>continues to impress me<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>unixReviewTime<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-c1">1401321600</span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>reviewTime<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>05 29, 2014<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>}</td>

A cute story and a good romance.  She is a chef operating her restaurant out of one of his properties.  They each have a very clever mother very anxious to become a grandmother.  So, they put their heads together to see what mischief they can come up with.The results are explosive.  The attraction is bigger than both of them.  There was a lot of sex rather quick but I think there had to be a little more than either of them realized to make it explode the way it did.  Her lease is about to expire and he holds all the cards to keeping her restaurant going or turning the property over to another chef.  Lots of things happen to tear these two apart but Mother Does Know Best.  They didn&#39;t have a chance.  You don&#39;t raise 6 boys without learning some pretty clever moves.I think this story was very. very good.  I enjoyed it and highly recommend it.  I thought it was long enough.  It got the story told without a lot of extra drama and events that just make a book longer and really add nothing to the story.  Give it a try, I think you will be glad you did.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;I really liked it.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1401062400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 26, 2014&quot;}</td>

Judging by this book he is 90% scientist and only 10% spiritual seeker. The only reason he gives for rejecting the materialist world view is that it is depressing and renders life meaningless. That&#39;s a good reason to be a spiritual seeker, but does not provide evidence for a different world view.The author believes life is meaningless without a belief in life in after death, so he writes about paranormal phenomena, OBEs, NDEs, and so forth. The problem is that he presents no compelling evidence for these things. His scientific side requires him to hedge and examine evidence for spiritual phenomena from a skeptical viewpoint. The author treats telekinesis, clairvoyance, telepathy, remote viewing, OBEs, NDEs, and so forth. But after examining the &amp;#34;evidence&amp;#34; in light if the author&#39;s scientific &amp;#34;weasel words,&amp;#34; you are less likely to believe in these things than to accept them as real. Even the author&#39;s single so-called PSI experience is very weak and unconvincing.The author states that &amp;#34;after death contacts&amp;#34; would provide the most compelling evidence for an afterlife, and then writes a chapter that concludes not only that there is NO evidence for such, but it is just too hard to study &amp;#34;scientifically.&amp;#34; The theme runs throughout the book that science has led us astray, yet we have no choice but to use the scientific method to set us back on the right path. As a practicing scientist with a reputation to uphold, the author attempts to both criticize science and appease his colleagues at the same time. How can the author believe that science is at once the problem AND the solution?The author&#39;s message boils down to this: &amp;#34;I want to believe in an afterlife, and in spite of the lack of evidence I WILL believe because the alternative is too depressing (meanwhile, I will look forward to the day when science gives me a good reason to believe)..&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Not At All Compelling&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1400889600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 24, 2014&quot;}</td>

Just like every early stage revolutions, Big Data has been equally misunderstood even among tech and business saavy people. For many Big Data , Data Science, Analytics are all interchangeable terminologies. This book takes care of that and lot more. Everyone will learn quiet a lot about Big data from this book,but specifically it is targeted for The Decision Makers.The most interesting feature in the book are the real world corporate examples ; stories to emphasize the point of view that makes it an interesting read for everyone. The slim 175 Pages is split across 8 Chapters:CHAPTERS:1. Why Big Data Is Important to You and Your Organization?2. How Big Data will change your job, Your Company and Your Industry?3. Developing a Big Data Strategy4. The Human Side Of Big Data5. Technology For Big Data6. What It takes to Succeed With Big Data7. What You Can Learn from Start-ups And Online Firms8. What You Can Learn From Large Companies: Big Data and Analytics 3.0.NOW FOR THE DETAILS :Chapter One : This is the superficial section of the book; The author does not use the boring Twitter data feed, Enormous Facebook data as an example which seems to be the staple diet for all Big data articles. Explains the difference between traditional analysis Vs Big Data . Cautions rightfully about Vendors who use the term \&quot;big data\&quot; on totally unrelated topics so can get your attention, ear and business.Chapter Two And Three: Goes over who will be impacted by Big data (Ex : If you move things, If you sell items, If Money is involved) and how . The nice examples involves Scenarios so everyone can relate to his business in some form or Other. This is a primer on the larger objectives around which you build your Big Data strategies . Do you want to save Money? Or is it that you want to introduce new product ? and so on. The sections are backed by tons of examples ( For that Matter, the entire book is one large story telling examples).Chapter Four And Five :  It is in a nutshell about \&quot;Data Scientist\&quot;. Who they are, and more importantly who is &#39;not a data scientist&#39;, The Shortage of getting resources, how it can be solved. If you want to be a data scientist, read this section, It explains how sizzling hot you are going to be. For a company , be cautious. The chapters go around  Hadoop and the technology that goes with it. Hadoop, Map reduce, how Big data will coexist with Data warehouse and so on. As an IT person , you should find this very useful.Chapter Six / Seven /Eight : Is a little more deeper analysis of the factors to have a successful Big data . The Data you need, the leadership you need, the type of Human resources need etc. The chapters are  glowing eulogy about the successful companies like Linkedin and the takeaway companies can leverage. If you are decision maker every of these chapters are interesting.Having said that, there is a better book on the same topic, which isBig Data: A Revolution That Will Transform How We Live, Work, and ThinkOn a personal note, My interest on big data spiked after the Harvard Business Review article which predicted Data Scientist as the sexiest job of the 21st Century. From there on. have been reading several books on these topics and hope to be a Cloudera Certified developer soon .&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Panoramic Birds Eye View Of Big Data&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1390435200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 23, 2014&quot;}</td>

After reading it, I don&amp;#8217;t think the blurb does it justice. This book felt like it was written as an erotic suspense with lots of twists and turns. I was gripped by the story from the beginning and could not put it down. I think it should have been said that this is a student/teacher romance. BUT don&amp;#8217;t allow preconceived notions to let that turn you off&amp;#8230;. trust me, this isn&amp;#8217;t what you&amp;#8217;re thinking. This book wasn&amp;#8217;t what I was expecting and I couldn&amp;#8217;t be happier about it.In the beginning, we meet Addison (Addy) and it&amp;#8217;s pretty clear she is in a mental institution. Her doctor &amp;#8220;Doc&amp;#8221; is trying to get her to talk and she seems to be in some kind of psychosis where she won&amp;#8217;t speak. I was really excited that the book just throws you off the cliff and you have to try and figure out what is happening. From the beginning all you know is that something is wrong and you want to know how she got there. The most intriguing part of the beginning of the book is that Addy keeps thinking she&amp;#8217;s alone and &amp;#8220;he&amp;#8221; is gone. The first three chapters of this book set an amazing tone of the story that follows. Addy was a dark and sexual character to get inside. I was captivated by her maturity even though she was young. I loved how she was so bold and not embarrassed by her body or her desires.Mr. McKendrick wasn&amp;#8217;t at all what I was expecting. When someone says student/teacher romance I immediately think the guy is going to be a sleazy creep. I assume he is preying on an innocent girl or taking advantage of a vulnerability. I can honestly say those thoughts NEVER crossed my mind with him. I felt like from the beginning he was trying to thwart Addy&amp;#8217;s advances. He was very clear that she was his student and it wasn&amp;#8217;t going to happen. He kept his distance and told her &amp;#8220;no&amp;#8221; repeatedly. I loved that he wasn&amp;#8217;t your typical guy looking for a young piece of a**. He was a man, who&amp;#8217;s heart connected to Addy&amp;#8217;s. I fell in love with Mr. McKendrick and I am not even the least bit ashamed. He does reveal his first name in the book, but it&amp;#8217;s such an intimate scene I&amp;#8217;ll let you find that out on your own.I am not even a little sorry at how much this book turned me on. I think I even said I was going to make my husband tell me &amp;#8220;no&amp;#8221; over and over again after I finished this book. I have never been so turned on in my life by a man trying to stop a woman&amp;#8217;s sexual advances. The tease, the build up, and the sex are 5 of 5 stars. My vagina and I were totally in agreement that this book was a sexual beast.For me, this book was an A. The story was suspenseful and captivating and I couldn&amp;#8217;t stop reading. I was wrapped in the mystery of what happened to Addy and why Mr. McKendrick was missing. I didn&amp;#8217;t see how this book was going to play out from the beginning, so I loved that it kept me on edge. I read this book in a day and was angry at myself for finishing it so fast. I don&amp;#8217;t know about the author&amp;#8217;s other books, but this blew me away. If you are looking for book that has a lot of heat, and a bit of a thriller aspect to it, then this is it! Loved it from beginning to end.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;I&amp;#8217;ll teach you how to come with a man inside you&amp;#8230;&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1398211200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 23, 2014&quot;}</td>

Stationed at Pearl Harbor, Morris Sullivan owes his survival to Robert Dobbins, a black seaman who died pulling his comrades from the water. Seeking closure, Morris is determined to thank Robert&amp;#8217;s family for his sacrifice, but his effort to honor a fallen hero blooms into a romance that will define the man he becomes and challenge everything he believes.Spanning the better part of five decades, A Life Apart, is a tedious historical, but under that it is a heartbreakingly beautiful novel of prejudice, strength, forgiveness and love that defies convention. I personally found Marlow&amp;#8217;s peppering of the story with tenuously relevant headlines from the 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s distracting, but the depth and earnestness of the love triangle she created between Morris, Beatrice and Agnes provided a powerfully moving thesis that struck me to the core.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;A Life Apart: A Novel&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1399075200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;05 3, 2014&quot;}</td>

I knew from her blog that she was a friend of Comer, and a very good one at that, but as a writer she still has a special way of wanting to write about someone with depth and caring. It wasn&#39;t just words on paper, she made his experiences come alive and you really cared what happened. If history could have been taught in school this way, I would have paid more attention. I almost didn&#39;t read it because I&#39;m not a history buff. At all. I shy away from these things. But because it was Vicky who wrote it and I loved her other books, I felt I should give it a chance. I am glad I did. She&#39;s a wonderful writer, but she also had wonderful material to work with. Give it a try. I don&#39;t believe you&#39;ll be disappointed.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Awesome book, even if you&#39;re not into war stories&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1402012800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 6, 2014&quot;}</td>

The further I read the more interesting and natural the story became. I loved the brothers and roommates in their own ways but I had a particular fondness for George and the prank wars between him and Kyle. Dean seemed like he was just trying to look out for Kyle but in doing so he didn&#39;t leave a lot of room for her to make her own decisions and I think it was actually doing more harm than good.I still have questions about the night that Kyle regrets the most in her life it just seemed liked we didn&#39;t get a lot of details of the aftermath or in fact the aftermath wasn&#39;t as serious as it seemed to be to affect Kyle in such a strong way. I was also a little confused about her family&#39;s reaction to Nick. One minute it seemed like they wanted her to stay away from him and the next it was like they just wanted her to move on from her previous relationship and get a boyfriends already.I loved Kyle but frankly he&#39;s still sort of a mystery to me. He&#39;s totally swoonworthy, I mean really a British accent, yes please. He is also patient and kind but persistent in his efforts to make Kyle understand how much he cares about her.Now can we talk about the last chapter and the ending? I have so many questions about Nick&#39;s sudden 360, what happened, what&#39;s going on? Then the way the book ended, say what? I was not expecting that at all and now I&#39;m biting my nails to find out what happens next.Over all I think this was a great debut and I could see the growth of the author from the beginning to the end of the book. I look forward to what she brings us in the next installment.*I received an ARC from the author/publisher in exchange for an honest review&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;3.5 Stars A great debut&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1396483200, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;04 3, 2014&quot;}</td>

I really like this story of the &amp;#34;special people&amp;#34; who are just learning about their abilities.  The Characters are vivid, and easy to read.  They feel tangible, as in, I can feel the people and their struggles.  The only complaint that I have for this book, is it is way too short.  This feels like the first 1-2 chapters of a larger book, and I was disappointed at the end.  I was left hanging, hoping for some more short stories soon.  If you are a fan of Becca&#39;s like I am, pick this up and read it.  If you need a longer story, wait for the next one to come out and then read them both at once.<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>overall<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-c1">4.0</span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>summary<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>A short story that begs for more...<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>unixReviewTime<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-c1">1404691200</span>, <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>reviewTime<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>: <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span>07 7, 2014<span class="pl-pds">&quot;</span></span>}</td>

It starts out with Kate being chased by men and Ethan saving her and helping her look for his brother. She doesn&#39;t trust him due to what his brother said. The men chasing didn&#39;t stop there, they turn up every time you turn around, throw in a few Indian children, a wild wolf, ghost, spirits and a few other things and you have a great read. You find yourself pulled into the story, looking for the brother who is looking for gold, but really wanting to find the father, seems everyone is looking for Ethan brother but not all for the same reason.There is all the romance you could ask for, the good and the bad along with the sad, throw in a little humor and you have a good read. Kate finds out a few things about Ethan&#39;s past that she doesn&#39;t know if she can forget much less forgive. To find the answers you will have to read the book. I promise you will not be disappointed.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;A great book&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1390694400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 26, 2014&quot;}</td>

Dom Matt involves his sub Adam in the plans for how to train Parker to come on command without any penetration or touch to his cock.The strategy they come up with involves strict discipline and the use of toys. When Gaston and Parker agree to the lessons they ask for demonstrations, so the reader gets two views of the same scene, once with the experienced couple and again with the trainees.Gaston has to convince Parker that if they do not achieve their goal they must put this behind them and move on. Parker, on the other hand, feels he should leave Gaston so he can find a sub who can follow any command Gaston cares to give. Either way, it&amp;#8217;s up to Gaston to make Parker feel successful.This is a very, very sexy story. It comes close to porn without plot but doesn&amp;#8217;t take that one extra step off the cliff, remaining grounded in the story of BDSM training.

Menon&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [3, 5], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;Much about the world always stays the same but in the background there are often big trends that are hard to see when in the thick of it.  In the Second Machine Age, authors Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee try to distinguish the forrest from the trees and discuss whats happening in the new digital age and how it is affecting us all economically.  This book discusses business trends and what is happening in information technology and analyzes it from the viewpoint of economics.  It gives perspective on the labour market, the rise of inequality, the needs of the new economy and the policies we should consider in this new environment.  It is always sensible and does its best to discuss issues evenly.  Despite us all living in this new technological age it is difficult to take a step back and try to get a true appreciation of whats going on is challenging.  This book aids in that process and helps frame the issues for the reader to think about.The authors start by considering human progress through our history.  They show how population growth as well as our social developement (as considered by Ian Morris in &amp;#34;Why the West Rules for Now&amp;#34;) has grown exponentially from the first industrial revolution and they discuss the technology and process that got us here.  The authors then discuss their experiences in the present and the journey they took in one of google&#39;s automated vehicles.  The author&#39;s argue that such applications of technology were not possible in the recent past but the exponential growth of computational power has enabled us to start doing things that seemed impossible just a few years ago.  They discuss the amazing progress in robotics and AI in the last few years and how this progress is just the beginning.  They give some metrics about how much information is getting digitized and how with the price of memory and processing going to 0 how much we have increased in terms of cataloguing.  In particular statistics like 10% of all the photos ever taken were taken last year with more photos taken every 2 minutes than in the entire 19th century.  The digitization of our daily lives is hard to fathom but when put in such terms the magnitude is astounding.  The authors then discuss innovation.  Recently the limits of human progress has been a hot topic of debate.  Robert Gordon recently questioned whether growth was sustainable and has argued the current growth trends and productivity enhancing innovations pale in comparison to the technologies of upheaval in the past.  The authors argue against this perspective and discuss the idea that growth comes from recombining old good ideas into better new ideas and how given how many more people are being brought into the new economy with the barriers to entry being low in the digital economy meaning we are in a new digital age of progress and we are at the beginning still.  The authors discuss how GDP as a measure is insufficient and how there is enormous consumer surplus created from recent technologies.  They discuss how the economy has migrated from rival to non-rival meaning that in the new economy the things we often value the most have negligible marginal cost of production.  An example being Wikipedia might destroy GDP by removing the need for labour for encyclopaedia britannica but has created massive consumer surplus for people at large.  The authors discuss how the new economy creates enormous economies of scale and as a result the distribution of incomes will be fundamentally altered as gains are not attributed to relative productivity but go to the very top at the expense of the rest.  The repurcussions being that average and median incomes continue to diverge and there is little natural reversion in that process.  The authors discuss what they think are ways for people to adapt to the new economy.  They give basic examples of how right now, at the core, people using machines are the ones enabled we are not in a machines purely replace people world.  The authors are very even and do not conclude that supply side innovations naturally create demand for labour and how fast innovation can run the risk of constantly leaving a portion of the population behind the production frontier.  At the same time the authors discuss ways in which we can address some of the adverse consequences of the digitization of the economy through intelligent policy.The Second Machine Age is a must read for those thinking about how the world has been changing since the dawn of the internet.  It is hard to not be convinced by much of what the author&#39;s discuss and the book is full of insight the reader can easily take away after reading.  It gives food for thought about what skills we should always be thinking about adding as well as broad social policy we might need for the future that has been different from the past.  This is one of the best books I have read in a while.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Excellent overview of developements in and repurcussions of digital age we live in&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1392422400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 15, 2014&quot;}</td>

Sakavic has captured the language of youth making it all the more real. A word of caution. You do have to place close attention to the background character explanations to get various relationships. This enables you to follow certain sequences. Admittedly, the author could have a bit more clarity in this area. Eventually, though, you figure it out.The problem I have with a series is when you have to wait for the final installment. It&#39;s rather a let down. But, I did read the conclusive segment should occur sometime January, 2014. I can hope. I have one issue with the second book that did follow a conventional mind set that bugs me.  Nicky(Neil&#39;s teammate and openly gay character) rants to Neil about the only way Neil will have a happy life is having a significant other.  Otherwise, this dooms Neil to a joyless life. I&#39;ve commented on this issue previously in other critiques. Are you telling me that even thought I have decent caring friends, a purposeful life, a loving relationship with myself open toward the other  that if I &#39;don&#39;t have someone&#39; I&#39;m doomed to a miserable life.? Listen up. There are people who lead a happy existence with caring attachments and are ok. Don&#39;t get me wrong. It is desirable to have a partner but not a need to prevent a fulfilling life. I&#39;ll stop now.Ah, don&#39;t let me distract from the fact that I still consider the second book highly recommendable.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Ok, I&#39;m left hanging  since the last book is yet not available.&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1388793600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 4, 2014&quot;}</td>

Two young people, damaged by their pasts find a friendship that relieves their feelings of isolation. As Robin and Phoenix find true acceptance with each other their feelings grow and they find love, even though neither believes they are deserving of it. Robin, a college student who became the campus party girl made a drunken mistake one night that will change her life and possibly destroy her best friend. As it haunts her every day, she isolates herself from those around her and vows never to drink again. Enter Phoenix, just released from prison, alone, with nothing but the borrowed clothes on his back, and a couch to sleep on at his cousins&amp;#8217; house. Phoenix seems to be in control of himself at all times, until any type of spark ignites the rage he keeps bottled up inside. Will these two find the support they need from each other or will they need to face their demons alone?Filled with angst, anger, guilt, and the tenuous threads of love, Believe is the story of two individuals who must learn to love themselves and accept that their own shortcomings are their greatest enemies while accepting that they are worthy of love that is given freely.Erin McCarthy has done a wonderful job creating characters that feel real and could be someone one could find on any campus when first cut loose into the world. Using the POVs of both main characters further illustrates her ability to give life to her tale. The fact that I wanted to shake them both one minute and hug them the next, means I was in the moment from start to finish. Her world is like a tour of campus life, the friendships and bonds, the turmoil of being a young person out on their own in a world they were not expecting. Another great read from this talented author.I received a review edition from PENGUIN GROUP Berkley, NAL / Signet Romance, DAW/Intermix in exchange for my honest review.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 4.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Sweet, Emotional, Romantic&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1391126400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;01 31, 2014&quot;}</td>

As a matter of fact, what she discovers about her family makes her literally ill with horror and fear.  For she mourns her father who loved her dearly but she also mourns the man as tyrant and killer who has tortured and killed thousands; at least he is responsible for these acts even if he has not literally carried them out himself in a single-handed way.  The word her friends use about the children&amp;#8217;s fairy tales and practices of her father&amp;#8217;s rule is &amp;#8220;barbaric,&amp;#8221; a painful word that sears through her mind and feelings for days and weeks.  How does one cope with her father&amp;#8217;s guilt, that which took the lives of families and friends of people she actually knows in America?Now Laila is in America.  Several people are interested in her, the man who is attempting to convince her mother to cooperate with CIA interests, the man who doesn&amp;#8217;t trust Laila initially but eventually will come to accept her at face value, and a normal American boy who wants to write a journalistic account of her father&amp;#8217;s life and her experiences in the nameless country from which she is in exile.  Its these relationships that evolve in dramatic ways that cause her to grow up fast.  Whether the reader thinks this evolution is healthy and good for Laila is left up to his or her imagination!We learn that her Uncle is now ruling the land Laila once called &amp;#8220;home.&amp;#8221;  He spends his time frantically calling Lails&amp;#8217;s mother.  Over time, Laila experiments with her new life in the United States, dressing like other girls do, dancing, and cultivating friendships that are &amp;#8220;normal&amp;#8221; for Americans but very, very different from what she knew before.  Meanwhile, she learns the truth about her family&amp;#8217;s place of &amp;#8220;royalty,&amp;#8221; and that changes her forever.  Her choices after that will affect her family and her former country forever!The author tells us, after the story ends, the seeds that planted this unforgettable story in her head and what she wished the reader to experience throughout the account and afterward.  J. C. Carleson brilliantly succeeds in her quest and the reader may reach his or her own decision regarding same.  This is a must read for American teenagers and adults, a side of life that could be any teenager in the Middle East or America, a side that calls for momentous decisions that could have planned or unforeseen consequences for history.  Superb novel and highly recommended historical fiction or contemporary fiction!&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;What If One Could Live a Different Life?&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1392681600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;02 18, 2014&quot;}</td>

Halford \&quot;Rookie Romance\&quot;&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [1, 1], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;Originally published at Rookie Romance.The blurb got me very excited, a wallflower and a criminal looking for redemption? Um, yes please!Audrey is a wallflower, but wants so much more from her life than what her parents have planned for her. She longs for adventure and an escape. She certainly dives head first into adventure when Ethan Jagger/Locke shows up injured at her window. I liked Audrey, she has guts and I admired her determination to enjoy her life and escape the box her parents were trying to put her in. But I found her actions rather puzzling in the first third of the book. I&#39;m not sure how much she knew Ethan previously, but her grandfather was just assaulted by some ruffians and she up and leaves with a man she barely knows who is clearly running from someone. Then when she realises that Ethan is running from Bow Street, she continues on her &#39;adventure&#39; with him. It just came across as kind of reckless and foolish, to be honest. Fair enough, I understood her motivations, but I read it with a raised eyebrow. Once Ethan and Audrey&#39;s relationship develops, the eyebrow lowered and it made sense that she stuck by him and defended him.Ethan has a criminal past that he&#39;s trying to put behind him. He wants nothing more than to let go of the past and mend his relationship with his brother, unfortunately that past does not want to let go of him. When he&#39;s falsely accused of murdering a Marquess, he&#39;s forced to literally run for his life. Ethan likes Audrey, but he never intended to bring her with him. As they spend more time together though,he realises that she&#39;s an unusual young lady and there&#39;s a lot more to her than meets the eye. Ethan has done a lot in his past that he regrets and he wants to become a better man, the man his father intended for him to be.I enjoyed Ethan and Audrey&#39;s relationship. I thought her optimism and innocence balanced his cynicism and made him a bit less jaded. Ethan is a good man at heart, and Audrey sees that man.I could get a little lost with all the characters, at times. It&#39;s part of a series and can be read as a stand alone, but there are a lot of characters who are clearly in the previous books in the series and it could be difficult to remember who was who. Although, it doesn&#39;t affect the reading of this book particularly.Overall, I liked it but I didn&#39;t love it. The characters held a lot of promise but fell a bit flat for me. I was left feeling luke warm about this, although I&#39;m interested to read some of the other character&#39;s stories in previous books of the series.*I received a review copy form the publisher, via NetGalley, for my honest opinion.

Unfortunately for the two of them, Logan is not the only obstacle to their happy ever after.  The reader will be completely surprised at which character(s) pose a deadly threat to Savannah and Kayden&amp;#8217;s happiness.Although I don&amp;#8217;t condone violence, I have to say that I love it that Savannah punched Logan.  While we have to constrain ourselves in the real world it was amazing to see a cheating guy get what he deserves on the written page.  Although I didn&amp;#8217;t think it possible, this sequel may have even surpassed the original in every way.  The sex is even hotter, the drama is even more intense, and the cliffhanger will leave your jaw on the floor.

She kept continually stating how \&quot;guys like him wouldn&#39;t fall for a heavy girl.\&quot;  Wow. This author has no idea the opportunity she had to show a strong confident larger woman who knew she was worth a lot and didn&#39;t need a man to define her. Skip this book it&#39;s too full of bad characters and self loathing and no redeeming value because the author further perpetuates the stereotype that full figure women would never attract a good looking man and if she did she was so lucky.  It should never only be about looks.  What a wasted opportunity for this author.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 1.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;A Review&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1403308800, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 21, 2014&quot;}</td>

Lee Zimmerman \&quot;Trekscribbler (aka Ed)\&quot;&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;: [0, 0], &quot;reviewText&quot;: &quot;Now that Dark Horse Comic&amp;#8217;s tenure with the Star Wars license is starting to wind down, I wanted to take some time to go back and reread some of the bigger, bolder titles that have seen release throughout the years.  Like many longtime readers, I&amp;#8217;m immeasurably bummed about the move of the comics from the Horse to the Mouse House of Marvel (I&amp;#8217;m really not looking forward to the Vader/Wolvie crossover); and &amp;#8211; in order to keep it real &amp;#8211; I&amp;#8217;m revisiting some of the yarns that made waves.One of the first big breakthroughs was something called DARK EMPIRE.  It went on to have a few sequels, but &amp;#8211; for my tastes &amp;#8211; I honestly didn&amp;#8217;t much care for this tale even when it first hit the shelves.  It isn&amp;#8217;t that I disliked the idea of exploring an Emperor Palpatine resurrected in the days of the New Republic fumbling to establish a firm footing; it&amp;#8217;s just that so much of Tom Veitch&amp;#8217;s story felt like character retreads.More after the break &amp;#8230;(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you&amp;#8217;re the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I&amp;#8217;d encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you&amp;#8217;re accepting of a few modest hints at &amp;#8216;things to come,&amp;#8217; then read on &amp;#8230;)Essentially, the story that unfolds here is that the Empire isn&amp;#8217;t quite as dead as our heroes &amp;#8211; Luke Skywalker, Leia Organa-Solo, Han Solo, and more &amp;#8211; long believed it to be.  In fact, some lingering elements in the inner galaxies have gone a long way toward re-establishing their own union, putting the New Republic back on its heels and having to fight in smaller isolated conflicts once more.  Naturally, this brings our gang back together, and they&amp;#8217;re rushed to the front lines in order to give yet one more &amp;#8216;New Hope&amp;#8217; street cred with faltering worlds.Lo and behold, our young Skywalker &amp;#8211; now a bit older &amp;#8211; discovers that the Emperor (aka Darth Sidious) has been resurrected (in a sense).  It would seem that his life essence has become a part of the living Dark Side &amp;#8211; much like Obi-wan Kenobi, Yoda, and Anakin Skywalker have merged with the Light Side elements; all the former Palpatine need do is pull a younger version of himself out of a clone canister and &amp;#8211; viola &amp;#8211; new Emperor!  Now, he&amp;#8217;s using some massive new weapons known as &amp;#8216;World Devastators&amp;#8217; to crush planets that won&amp;#8217;t bend to his will.Just as was the thematic undercurrent for the Luke Skywalker character in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and RETURN OF THE JEDI (and many, many Extended Universe tales since then), this new Emperor wants to turn our hero to the Dark Side.  What makes this tale a bit different is that the Jedi seemingly does embrace it, though he admits to readers over and over again that he&amp;#8217;s done so only to get closer to Palpatine so that he can inevitably defeat him.  Leia, Han, and the others don&amp;#8217;t see as clearly what Luke&amp;#8217;s motivations are, so they spend the bulk of their time trying to contact the Jedi Master so they can &amp;#8216;reclaim&amp;#8217; him for their side &amp;#8230; and, so far as I can tell, that about wraps it up.DARK EMPIRE is a worthy read, but it&amp;#8217;s nothing that really smacks of originality or epicness (if you&amp;#8217;ll pardon my creation of the word).  The Emperor is the same &amp;#8211; as are all of our regular players &amp;#8211; so nothing new added to the mix pretty much leaves this tale tasting like something we&amp;#8217;ve all had before.  That in itself isn&amp;#8217;t enough reason to resist the story&amp;#8217;s obvious temptations &amp;#8211; could it be that Luke won&amp;#8217;t survive the Emperor&amp;#8217;s machinations this time? &amp;#8211; which is why I basically deem it worth a read but little else.  Plus, DARK EMPIRE has a weird artistic template; it&amp;#8217;s almost as if illustrator Cam Kennedy (who does terrific work) made some curious decision to color the worlds of George Lucas monochromatically, and, for the life of me, I can&amp;#8217;t figure out how anyone thought that was a good idea.  (???)  One of the most enduring qualities of STAR WARS is how different the various worlds and machines and droids look from one to another, so casting so very many panels in as few color choices as possible makes no narrative much less commercial sense.Heck, even the long-rumored dead Boba Fett shows up for what plays out like an almost obligator appearance, one meant to recapture the magic of the bounty hunters glory days instead of adding legitimacy to the web being spun here.  I like Boba Fett.  I get most fanboys like Boba Fett.  But his appearance here?  It just didn&amp;#8217;t need to be.RECOMMENDED.  I&amp;#8217;m smitten with most of the Dark Horse&amp;#8217;s adventures from a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away; still, there&amp;#8217;s something about DARK EMPIRE that just underwhelmed me.  There were a few moments of greatness &amp;#8211; Luke&amp;#8217;s commitment to kinda/sorta bringing the Force into balance; Leia&amp;#8217;s love for family despite the obvious hardships; Han&amp;#8217;s ribbing of his brother-in-law; etc. &amp;#8211; but most of them underscore relationships already so firmly established that there was little new brought to the game.  Otherwise, much of this tale flew on autopilot, and it was hardly as DARK as it could&amp;#8217;ve been.  Good &amp;#8211; worth a read &amp;#8211; but far from great.&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 3.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;Blast from the Past: DARK EMPIRE Reconsidered After All These Years&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1404086400, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 30, 2014&quot;}</td>

The work together to find safety and help and despite their differences, they fall for each other.I thought the novel was well-written. The authors did a nice job of painting a picture in my head of the world the characters live in. There was also a captivating plot as the characters encounter strange happenings on the planet. Ultimately, it&amp;#8217;s a love story though and I thought that even though rich girl and poor boy fall in love is somewhat clich&amp;eacute;, the love story was well done. My son read this book and said it was alright. He most likely enjoyed the science fiction aspect best. I think he might get more out of it when he&amp;#8217;s in middle school.

These ideas really never get a chance to blossom before she&#39;s on to the next one leaving the reader confused as to what is going on and more importantly why. This has been one of my complaints with this series is that it seems to be over as soon as its begun. Just enough to keep us intrigued but not enough depth to really get us involved.I gave the book 2 stars because it does give us more insight into the storyline of the rest of the series.

Through his usual narrative, there comes some clarity which has left Civil War novices confused about the Vicksburg Campaign and the novel stands as a great introduction for those people interested in something besides the War in the East.  The second part of his series is a welcome addition not only to the bookshelves of Civil War buffs, but the literary world as well.Jeff Shaara is a New York Times bestseller and began his career with the work preceding his father&amp;#8217;s called Gods and Generals and finished the story with The Last Full Measure.  Shaara has won numerous accolades for his works on the revolution called Rise to Rebellion and The Glorious Cause.  After his series on the Civil War in the West, he will be pursuing the Texas conflict and the Korean War.For the first time in his career, Jeff Shaara has given us the outlook of a woman.  She does not have just one chapter, but many telling the story of the civilians who had to hide out in the caves and sometimes gave their services as nurses.  The narrative of the hospitals is gruesome and not for the faint of heart, but even more so, the narrative of life in the caves is even worse.  There are some points in literature which stick with you for the rest of your life and his description of life in the caves and the starvation of the men and women of the city of Vicksburg is one of those passages.  Whether it be the slaughter of the horses so they could eat all the way down to killing dogs for food, the disturbing image comes when there is no reservation about eating these animals.  Even the conditions of the high command of the Confederate army is deplorable.  In this volume, Shaara chooses to use Pemberton as the voice of the Confederate command structure instead of Johnston and rightfully so.  Pemberton was more the defender of Vicksburg than any other commander.  He does, however, give Pemberton the same treatment his father gave Longstreet in The Killer Angels.  He has taken a character which was not always in good light and given him a favorable view.  In the end, you feel sorry for Pemberton and wonder what he could have done to further his fight.  But knowing there was nothing for him to do was quite sad and some say could change the opinions of people about the man.  On the Union side,  we have the regulars from the last book, A Blaze of Glory, with Private Bauer from the 17th Wisconsin and General Sherman.  Something, however, can be said about reading a book with the opposition has the upper hand constantly in the campaign.  While there are small battles throughout the siege which the Union army loses, there is something in the back of the reader&amp;#8217;s mind saying that they still have the upper hand in the situation which makes this book a bit more history than novel.  Which brings me to the major point of my review.  A Chain of Thunder is a good book, but is more nonfiction novel than an actual historical fiction book.  I learned more about the Vicksburg Campaign in this book than I have learned from any of his other works and once again, Shaara shines when he only has to worry about a single campaign or battle instead of stretching the work over a few years.I recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of historical fiction because while being such, it is quite different from what the standard is for those types of works.  The detail in which is gives to the campaign of Vicksburg is quite good and while he makes the reader feel sympathy for the Confederate army, there is still an even divide between the Union and Confederate accounts.  Jeff Shaara&amp;#8217;s War in the West series is a very welcome addition to my own Civil War library and should be a welcome addition to any other history fan as well.Matthew Bartlett - Author, Gettysburg Chronicle&quot;, &quot;overall&quot;: 5.0, &quot;summary&quot;: &quot;General Pemberton Finally Gets His Due Diligence&quot;, &quot;unixReviewTime&quot;: 1403481600, &quot;reviewTime&quot;: &quot;06 23, 2014&quot;}</td>

The blending of classic superhero tropes with zombie survival is a great blend, far better than I would have expected. I further appreciate the detail that Mr. Clines goes into, particularly with regard to Captain Freedom&#39;s military background. It adds a wonderful richness to the world.The biggest compliment that I can give the book (as well as the series) is that I was willing to pay more than $.99 or $1.99 for it.
